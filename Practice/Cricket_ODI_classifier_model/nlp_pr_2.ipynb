      "[ The Tragedie of Macbeth by William Shakespeare 1603 ] Actus Primus . Scoena Prima . Thunder and Lightning . Enter three Witches . 1 . When shall we three meet againe ? In Thunder , Lightning , or in Raine ? 2 . When the Hurley - burley ' s done , When the Battaile ' s lost , and wonne 3 . That will be ere the set of Sunne 1 . Where the place ? 2 . Vpon the Heath 3 . There to meet with Macbeth 1 . I come , Gray - Malkin All . Padock calls anon : faire is foule , and foule is faire , Houer through the fogge and filthie ayre . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Alarum within . Enter King Malcome , Donalbaine , Lenox , with attendants , meeting a bleeding Captaine . King . What bloody man is that ? he can report , As seemeth by his plight , of the Reuolt The newest state Mal . This is the Serieant , Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought ' Gainst my Captiuitie : Haile braue friend ; Say to the King , the knowledge of the Broyle , As thou didst leaue it Cap . Doubtfull it stood , As two spent Swimmers , that doe cling together , And choake their Art : The mercilesse Macdonwald ( Worthie to be a Rebell , for to that The multiplying Villanies of Nature Doe swarme vpon him ) from the Westerne Isles Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply ' d , And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling , Shew ' d like a Rebells Whore : but all ' s too weake : For braue Macbeth ( well hee deserues that Name ) Disdayning Fortune , with his brandisht Steele , Which smoak ' d with bloody execution ( Like Valours Minion ) caru ' d out his passage , Till hee fac ' d the Slaue : Which neu ' r shooke hands , nor bad farwell to him , Till he vnseam ' d him from the Naue toth ' Chops , And fix ' d his Head vpon our Battlements King . O valiant Cousin , worthy Gentleman Cap . As whence the Sunne ' gins his reflection , Shipwracking Stormes , and direfull Thunders : So from that Spring , whence comfort seem ' d to come , Discomfort swells : Marke King of Scotland , marke , No sooner Iustice had , with Valour arm ' d , Compell ' d these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles , But the Norweyan Lord , surueying vantage , With furbusht Armes , and new supplyes of men , Began a fresh assault King . Dismay ' d not this our Captaines , Macbeth and Banquoh ? Cap . Yes , as Sparrowes , Eagles ; Or the Hare , the Lyon : If I say sooth , I must report they were As Cannons ouer - charg ' d with double Cracks , So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I cannot tell : but I am faint , My Gashes cry for helpe King . So well thy words become thee , as thy wounds , They smack of Honor both : Goe get him Surgeons . Enter Rosse and Angus . Who comes here ? Mal . The worthy Thane of Rosse Lenox . What a haste lookes through his eyes ? So should he looke , that seemes to speake things strange Rosse . God saue the King King . Whence cam ' st thou , worthy Thane ? Rosse . From Fiffe , great King , Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie , And fanne our people cold . Norway himselfe , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor , The Thane of Cawdor , began a dismall Conflict , Till that Bellona ' s Bridegroome , lapt in proofe , Confronted him with selfe - comparisons , Point against Point , rebellious Arme ' gainst Arme , Curbing his lauish spirit : and to conclude , The Victorie fell on vs King . Great happinesse Rosse . That now Sweno , the Norwayes King , Craues composition : Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men , Till he disbursed , at Saint Colmes ynch , Ten thousand Dollars , to our generall vse King . No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue Our Bosome interest : Goe pronounce his present death , And with his former Title greet Macbeth Rosse . Ile see it done King . What he hath lost , Noble Macbeth hath wonne . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Thunder . Enter the three Witches . 1 . Where hast thou beene , Sister ? 2 . Killing Swine 3 . Sister , where thou ? 1 . A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe , And mouncht , & mouncht , and mouncht : Giue me , quoth I . Aroynt thee , Witch , the rumpe - fed Ronyon cryes . Her Husband ' s to Aleppo gone , Master o ' th ' Tiger : But in a Syue Ile thither sayle , And like a Rat without a tayle , Ile doe , Ile doe , and Ile doe 2 . Ile giue thee a Winde 1 . Th ' art kinde 3 . And I another 1 . I my selfe haue all the other , And the very Ports they blow , All the Quarters that they know , I ' th ' Ship - mans Card . Ile dreyne him drie as Hay : Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day Hang vpon his Pent - house Lid : He shall liue a man forbid : Wearie Seu ' nights , nine times nine , Shall he dwindle , peake , and pine : Though his Barke cannot be lost , Yet it shall be Tempest - tost . Looke what I haue 2 . Shew me , shew me 1 . Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe , Wrackt , as homeward he did come . Drum within . 3 . A Drumme , a Drumme : Macbeth doth come All . The weyward Sisters , hand in hand , Posters of the Sea and Land , Thus doe goe , about , about , Thrice to thine , and thrice to mine , And thrice againe , to make vp nine . Peace , the Charme ' s wound vp . Enter Macbeth and Banquo . Macb . So foule and faire a day I haue not seene Banquo . How farre is ' t call ' d to Soris ? What are these , So wither ' d , and so wilde in their attyre , That looke not like th ' Inhabitants o ' th ' Earth , And yet are on ' t ? Liue you , or are you aught That man may question ? you seeme to vnderstand me , By each at once her choppie finger laying Vpon her skinnie Lips : you should be Women , And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete That you are so Mac . Speake if you can : what are you ? 1 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Glamis 2 . All haile Macbeth , haile to thee Thane of Cawdor 3 . All haile Macbeth , that shalt be King hereafter Banq . Good Sir , why doe you start , and seeme to feare Things that doe sound so faire ? i ' th ' name of truth Are ye fantasticall , or that indeed Which outwardly ye shew ? My Noble Partner You greet with present Grace , and great prediction Of Noble hauing , and of Royall hope , That he seemes wrapt withall : to me you speake not . If you can looke into the Seedes of Time , And say , which Graine will grow , and which will not , Speake then to me , who neyther begge , nor feare Your fauors , nor your hate 1 . Hayle 2 . Hayle 3 . Hayle 1 . Lesser than Macbeth , and greater 2 . Not so happy , yet much happyer 3 . Thou shalt get Kings , though thou be none : So all haile Macbeth , and Banquo 1 . Banquo , and Macbeth , all haile Macb . Stay you imperfect Speakers , tell me more : By Sinells death , I know I am Thane of Glamis , But how , of Cawdor ? the Thane of Cawdor liues A prosperous Gentleman : And to be King , Stands not within the prospect of beleefe , No more then to be Cawdor . Say from whence You owe this strange Intelligence , or why Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way With such Prophetique greeting ? Speake , I charge you . Witches vanish . Banq . The Earth hath bubbles , as the Water ha ' s , And these are of them : whither are they vanish ' d ? Macb . Into the Ayre : and what seem ' d corporall , Melted , as breath into the Winde . Would they had stay ' d Banq . Were such things here , as we doe speake about ? Or haue we eaten on the insane Root , That takes the Reason Prisoner ? Macb . Your Children shall be Kings Banq . You shall be King Macb . And Thane of Cawdor too : went it not so ? Banq . Toth ' selfe - same tune and words : who ' s here ? Enter Rosse and Angus . Rosse . The King hath happily receiu ' d , Macbeth , The newes of thy successe : and when he reades Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight , His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend , Which should be thine , or his : silenc ' d with that , In viewing o ' re the rest o ' th ' selfe - same day , He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes , Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make Strange Images of death , as thick as Tale Can post with post , and euery one did beare Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence , And powr ' d them downe before him Ang . Wee are sent , To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks , Onely to harrold thee into his sight , Not pay thee Rosse . And for an earnest of a greater Honor , He bad me , from him , call thee Thane of Cawdor : In which addition , haile most worthy Thane , For it is thine Banq . What , can the Deuill speake true ? Macb . The Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ? Ang . Who was the Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose . Whether he was combin ' d with those of Norway , Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour ' d In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess ' d , and prou ' d , Haue ouerthrowne him Macb . Glamys , and Thane of Cawdor : The greatest is behinde . Thankes for your paines . Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings , When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me , Promis ' d no lesse to them Banq . That trusted home , Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne , Besides the Thane of Cawdor . But ' tis strange : And oftentimes , to winne vs to our harme , The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths , Winne vs with honest Trifles , to betray ' s In deepest consequence . Cousins , a word , I pray you Macb . Two Truths are told , As happy Prologues to the swelling Act Of the Imperiall Theame . I thanke you Gentlemen : This supernaturall solliciting Cannot be ill ; cannot be good . If ill ? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe , Commencing in a Truth ? I am Thane of Cawdor . If good ? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion , Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire , And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes , Against the vse of Nature ? Present Feares Are lesse then horrible Imaginings : My Thought , whose Murther yet is but fantasticall , Shakes so my single state of Man , That Function is smother ' d in surmise , And nothing is , but what is not Banq . Looke how our Partner ' s rapt Macb . If Chance will haue me King , Why Chance may Crowne me , Without my stirre Banq . New Honors come vpon him Like our strange Garments , cleaue not to their mould , But with the aid of vse Macb . Come what come may , Time , and the Houre , runs through the roughest Day Banq . Worthy Macbeth , wee stay vpon your leysure Macb . Giue me your fauour : My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten . Kinde Gentlemen , your paines are registred , Where euery day I turne the Leafe , To reade them . Let vs toward the King : thinke vpon What hath chanc ' d : and at more time , The Interim hauing weigh ' d it , let vs speake Our free Hearts each to other Banq . Very gladly Macb . Till then enough : Come friends . Exeunt . Scena Quarta . Flourish . Enter King , Lenox , Malcolme , Donalbaine , and Attendants . King . Is execution done on Cawdor ? Or not those in Commission yet return ' d ? Mal . My Liege , they are not yet come back . But I haue spoke with one that saw him die : Who did report , that very frankly hee Confess ' d his Treasons , implor ' d your Highnesse Pardon , And set forth a deepe Repentance : Nothing in his Life became him , Like the leauing it . Hee dy ' de , As one that had beene studied in his death , To throw away the dearest thing he ow ' d , As ' twere a carelesse Trifle King . There ' s no Art , To finde the Mindes construction in the Face . He was a Gentleman , on whom I built An absolute Trust . Enter Macbeth , Banquo , Rosse , and Angus . O worthyest Cousin , The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now Was heauie on me . Thou art so farre before , That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow , To ouertake thee . Would thou hadst lesse deseru ' d , That the proportion both of thanks , and payment , Might haue beene mine : onely I haue left to say , More is thy due , then more then all can pay Macb . The seruice , and the loyaltie I owe , In doing it , payes it selfe . Your Highnesse part , is to receiue our Duties : And our Duties are to your Throne , and State , Children , and Seruants ; which doe but what they should , By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue And Honor King . Welcome hither : I haue begun to plant thee , and will labour To make thee full of growing . Noble Banquo , That hast no lesse deseru ' d , nor must be knowne No lesse to haue done so : Let me enfold thee , And hold thee to my Heart Banq . There if I grow , The Haruest is your owne King . My plenteous Ioyes , Wanton in fulnesse , seeke to hide themselues In drops of sorrow . Sonnes , Kinsmen , Thanes , And you whose places are the nearest , know , We will establish our Estate vpon Our eldest , Malcolme , whom we name hereafter , The Prince of Cumberland : which Honor must Not vnaccompanied , inuest him onely , But signes of Noblenesse , like Starres , shall shine On all deseruers . From hence to Envernes , And binde vs further to you Macb . The Rest is Labor , which is not vs ' d for you : Ile be my selfe the Herbenger , and make ioyfull The hearing of my Wife , with your approach : So humbly take my leaue King . My worthy Cawdor Macb . The Prince of Cumberland : that is a step , On which I must fall downe , or else o ' re - leape , For in my way it lyes . Starres hide your fires , Let not Light see my black and deepe desires : The Eye winke at the Hand : yet let that bee , Which the Eye feares , when it is done to see . Enter . King . True worthy Banquo : he is full so valiant , And in his commendations , I am fed : It is a Banquet to me . Let ' s after him , Whose care is gone before , to bid vs welcome : It is a peerelesse Kinsman . Flourish . Exeunt . Scena Quinta . Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter . Lady . They met me in the day of successe : and I haue learn ' d by the perfect ' st report , they haue more in them , then mortall knowledge . When I burnt in desire to question them further , they made themselues Ayre , into which they vanish ' d . Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it , came Missiues from the King , who all - hail ' d me Thane of Cawdor , by which Title before , these weyward Sisters saluted me , and referr ' d me to the comming on of time , with haile King that shalt be . This haue I thought good to deliuer thee ( my dearest Partner of Greatnesse ) that thou might ' st not loose the dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis ' d thee . Lay it to thy heart and farewell . Glamys thou art , and Cawdor , and shalt be What thou art promis ' d : yet doe I feare thy Nature , It is too full o ' th ' Milke of humane kindnesse , To catch the neerest way . Thou would ' st be great , Art not without Ambition , but without The illnesse should attend it . What thou would ' st highly , That would ' st thou holily : would ' st not play false , And yet would ' st wrongly winne . Thould ' st haue , great Glamys , that which cryes , Thus thou must doe , if thou haue it ; And that which rather thou do ' st feare to doe , Then wishest should be vndone . High thee hither , That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare , And chastise with the valour of my Tongue All that impeides thee from the Golden Round , Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme To haue thee crown ' d withall . Enter Messenger . What is your tidings ? Mess . The King comes here to Night Lady . Thou ' rt mad to say it . Is not thy Master with him ? who , wer ' t so , Would haue inform ' d for preparation Mess . So please you , it is true : our Thane is comming : One of my fellowes had the speed of him ; Who almost dead for breath , had scarcely more Then would make vp his Message Lady . Giue him tending , He brings great newes , Exit Messenger . The Rauen himselfe is hoarse , That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan Vnder my Battlements . Come you Spirits , That tend on mortall thoughts , vnsex me here , And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe , top - full Of direst Crueltie : make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit . Come to my Womans Brests , And take my Milke for Gall , you murth ' ring Ministers , Where - euer , in your sightlesse substances , You wait on Natures Mischiefe . Come thick Night , And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell , That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes , Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke , To cry , hold , hold . Enter Macbeth . Great Glamys , worthy Cawdor , Greater then both , by the all - haile hereafter , Thy Letters haue transported me beyond This ignorant present , and I feele now The future in the instant Macb . My dearest Loue , Duncan comes here to Night Lady . And when goes hence ? Macb . To morrow , as he purposes Lady . O neuer , Shall Sunne that Morrow see . Your Face , my Thane , is as a Booke , where men May reade strange matters , to beguile the time . Looke like the time , beare welcome in your Eye , Your Hand , your Tongue : looke like th ' innocent flower , But be the Serpent vnder ' t . He that ' s comming , Must be prouided for : and you shall put This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch , Which shall to all our Nights , and Dayes to come , Giue solely soueraigne sway , and Masterdome Macb . We will speake further , Lady . Onely looke vp cleare : To alter fauor , euer is to feare : Leaue all the rest to me . Exeunt . Scena Sexta . Hoboyes , and Torches . Enter King , Malcolme , Donalbaine , Banquo , Lenox , Macduff , Rosse , Angus , and Attendants . King . This Castle hath a pleasant seat , The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe Vnto our gentle sences Banq . This Guest of Summer , The Temple - haunting Barlet does approue , By his loued Mansonry , that the Heauens breath Smells wooingly here : no Iutty frieze , Buttrice , nor Coigne of Vantage , but this Bird Hath made his pendant Bed , and procreant Cradle , Where they must breed , and haunt : I haue obseru ' d The ayre is delicate . Enter Lady . King . See , see our honor ' d Hostesse : The Loue that followes vs , sometime is our trouble , Which still we thanke as Loue . Herein I teach you , How you shall bid God - eyld vs for your paines , And thanke vs for your trouble Lady . All our seruice , In euery point twice done , and then done double , Were poore , and single Businesse , to contend Against those Honors deepe , and broad , Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House : For those of old , and the late Dignities , Heap ' d vp to them , we rest your Ermites King . Where ' s the Thane of Cawdor ? We courst him at the heeles , and had a purpose To be his Purueyor : But he rides well , And his great Loue ( sharpe as his Spurre ) hath holp him To his home before vs : Faire and Noble Hostesse We are your guest to night La . Your Seruants euer , Haue theirs , themselues , and what is theirs in compt , To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure , Still to returne your owne King . Giue me your hand : Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly , And shall continue , our Graces towards him . By your leaue Hostesse . Exeunt . Scena Septima . Hoboyes . Torches . Enter a Sewer , and diuers Seruants with Dishes and Seruice ouer the Stage . Then enter Macbeth Macb . If it were done , when ' tis done , then ' twer well , It were done quickly : If th ' Assassination Could trammell vp the Consequence , and catch With his surcease , Successe : that but this blow Might be the be all , and the end all . Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee ' ld iumpe the life to come . But in these Cases , We still haue iudgement heere , that we but teach Bloody Instructions , which being taught , returne To plague th ' Inuenter , this euen - handed Iustice Commends th ' Ingredience of our poyson ' d Challice To our owne lips . Hee ' s heere in double trust ; First , as I am his Kinsman , and his Subiect , Strong both against the Deed : Then , as his Host , Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore , Not beare the knife my selfe . Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against The deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like a naked New - borne - Babe , Striding the blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre , Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne the winde . I haue no Spurre To pricke the sides of my intent , but onely Vaulting Ambition , which ore - leapes it selfe , And falles on th ' other . Enter Lady . How now ? What Newes ? La . He has almost supt : why haue you left the chamber ? Mac . Hath he ask ' d for me ? La . Know you not , he ha ' s ? Mac . We will proceed no further in this Businesse : He hath Honour ' d me of late , and I haue bought Golden Opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worne now in their newest glosse , Not cast aside so soone La . Was the hope drunke , Wherein you drest your selfe ? Hath it slept since ? And wakes it now to looke so greene , and pale , At what it did so freely ? From this time , Such I account thy loue . Art thou affear ' d To be the same in thine owne Act , and Valour , As thou art in desire ? Would ' st thou haue that Which thou esteem ' st the Ornament of Life , And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme ? Letting I dare not , wait vpon I would , Like the poore Cat i ' th ' Addage Macb . Prythee peace : I dare do all that may become a man , Who dares do more , is none La . What Beast was ' t then That made you breake this enterprize to me ? When you durst do it , then you were a man : And to be more then what you were , you would Be so much more the man . Nor time , nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They haue made themselues , and that their fitnesse now Do ' s vnmake you . I haue giuen Sucke , and know How tender ' tis to loue the Babe that milkes me , I would , while it was smyling in my Face , Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes , And dasht the Braines out , had I so sworne As you haue done to this Macb . If we should faile ? Lady . We faile ? But screw your courage to the sticking place , And wee ' le not fayle : when Duncan is asleepe , ( Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney Soundly inuite him ) his two Chamberlaines Will I with Wine , and Wassell , so conuince , That Memorie , the Warder of the Braine , Shall be a Fume , and the Receit of Reason A Lymbeck onely : when in Swinish sleepe , Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death , What cannot you and I performe vpon Th ' vnguarded Duncan ? What not put vpon His spungie Officers ? who shall beare the guilt Of our great quell Macb . Bring forth Men - Children onely : For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose Nothing but Males . Will it not be receiu ' d , When we haue mark ' d with blood those sleepie two Of his owne Chamber , and vs ' d their very Daggers , That they haue don ' t ? Lady . Who dares receiue it other , As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore , Vpon his Death ? Macb . I am settled , and bend vp Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat . Away , and mock the time with fairest show , False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know . Exeunt . Actus Secundus . Scena Prima . Enter Banquo , and Fleance , with a Torch before him . Banq . How goes the Night , Boy ? Fleance . The Moone is downe : I haue not heard the Clock Banq . And she goes downe at Twelue Fleance . I take ' t , ' tis later , Sir Banq . Hold , take my Sword : There ' s Husbandry in Heauen , Their Candles are all out : take thee that too . A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me , And yet I would not sleepe : Mercifull Powers , restraine in me the cursed thoughts That Nature giues way to in repose . Enter Macbeth , and a Seruant with a Torch . Giue me my Sword : who ' s there ? Macb . A Friend Banq . What Sir , not yet at rest ? the King ' s a bed . He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure , And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices . This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall , By the name of most kind Hostesse , And shut vp in measurelesse content Mac . Being vnprepar ' d , Our will became the seruant to defect , Which else should free haue wrought Banq . All ' s well . I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters : To you they haue shew ' d some truth Macb . I thinke not of them : Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue , We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse , If you would graunt the time Banq . At your kind ' st leysure Macb . If you shall cleaue to my consent , When ' tis , it shall make Honor for you Banq . So I lose none , In seeking to augment it , but still keepe My Bosome franchis ' d , and Allegeance cleare , I shall be counsail ' d Macb . Good repose the while Banq . Thankes Sir : the like to you . Exit Banquo . Macb . Goe bid thy Mistresse , when my drinke is ready , She strike vpon the Bell . Get thee to bed . Enter . Is this a Dagger , which I see before me , The Handle toward my Hand ? Come , let me clutch thee : I haue thee not , and yet I see thee still . Art thou not fatall Vision , sensible To feeling , as to sight ? or art thou but A Dagger of the Minde , a false Creation , Proceeding from the heat - oppressed Braine ? I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw . Thou marshall ' st me the way that I was going , And such an Instrument I was to vse . Mine Eyes are made the fooles o ' th ' other Sences , Or else worth all the rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before . There ' s no such thing : It is the bloody Businesse , which informes Thus to mine Eyes . Now o ' re the one halfe World Nature seemes dead , and wicked Dreames abuse The Curtain ' d sleepe : Witchcraft celebrates Pale Heccats Offrings : and wither ' d Murther , Alarum ' d by his Centinell , the Wolfe , Whose howle ' s his Watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquins rauishing sides , towards his designe Moues like a Ghost . Thou sowre and firme - set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where - about , And take the present horror from the time , Which now sutes with it . Whiles I threat , he liues : Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues . A Bell rings . I goe , and it is done : the Bell inuites me . Heare it not , Duncan , for it is a Knell , That summons thee to Heauen , or to Hell . Enter . Scena Secunda . Enter Lady . La . That which hath made the [ m ] drunk , hath made me bold : What hath quench ' d them , hath giuen me fire . Hearke , peace : it was the Owle that shriek ' d , The fatall Bell - man , which giues the stern ' st good - night . He is about it , the Doores are open : And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge With Snores . I haue drugg ' d their Possets , That Death and Nature doe contend about them , Whether they liue , or dye . Enter Macbeth . Macb . Who ' s there ? what hoa ? Lady . Alack , I am afraid they haue awak ' d , And ' tis not done : th ' attempt , and not the deed , Confounds vs : hearke : I lay ' d their Daggers ready , He could not misse ' em . Had he not resembled My Father as he slept , I had don ' t . My Husband ? Macb . I haue done the deed : Didst thou not heare a noyse ? Lady . I heard the Owle schreame , and the Crickets cry . Did not you speake ? Macb . When ? Lady . Now Macb . As I descended ? Lady . I Macb . Hearke , who lyes i ' th ' second Chamber ? Lady . Donalbaine Mac . This is a sorry sight Lady . A foolish thought , to say a sorry sight Macb . There ' s one did laugh in ' s sleepe , And one cry ' d Murther , that they did wake each other : I stood , and heard them : But they did say their Prayers , And addrest them againe to sleepe Lady . There are two lodg ' d together Macb . One cry ' d God blesse vs , and Amen the other , As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands : Listning their feare , I could not say Amen , When they did say God blesse vs Lady . Consider it not so deepely Mac . But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen ? I had most need of Blessing , and Amen stuck in my throat Lady . These deeds must not be thought After these wayes : so , it will make vs mad Macb . Me thought I heard a voyce cry , Sleep no more : Macbeth does murther Sleepe , the innocent Sleepe , Sleepe that knits vp the rauel ' d Sleeue of Care , The death of each dayes Life , sore Labors Bath , Balme of hurt Mindes , great Natures second Course , Chiefe nourisher in Life ' s Feast Lady . What doe you meane ? Macb . Still it cry ' d , Sleepe no more to all the House : Glamis hath murther ' d Sleepe , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleepe no more : Macbeth shall sleepe no more Lady . Who was it , that thus cry ' d ? why worthy Thane , You doe vnbend your Noble strength , to thinke So braine - sickly of things : Goe get some Water , And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand . Why did you bring these Daggers from the place ? They must lye there : goe carry them , and smeare The sleepie Groomes with blood Macb . Ile goe no more : I am afraid , to thinke what I haue done : Looke on ' t againe , I dare not Lady . Infirme of purpose : Giue me the Daggers : the sleeping , and the dead , Are but as Pictures : ' tis the Eye of Childhood , That feares a painted Deuill . If he doe bleed , Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall , For it must seeme their Guilt . Enter . Knocke within . Macb . Whence is that knocking ? How is ' t with me , when euery noyse appalls me ? What Hands are here ? hah : they pluck out mine Eyes . Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood Cleane from my Hand ? no : this my Hand will rather The multitudinous Seas incarnardine , Making the Greene one , Red . Enter Lady . Lady . My Hands are of your colour : but I shame To weare a Heart so white . Knocke . I heare a knocking at the South entry : Retyre we to our Chamber : A little Water cleares vs of this deed . How easie is it then ? your Constancie Hath left you vnattended . Knocke . Hearke , more knocking . Get on your Night - Gowne , least occasion call vs , And shew vs to be Watchers : be not lost So poorely in your thoughts Macb . To know my deed , Knocke . ' Twere best not know my selfe . Wake Duncan with thy knocking : I would thou could ' st . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Enter a Porter . Knocking within . Porter . Here ' s a knocking indeede : if a man were Porter of Hell Gate , hee should haue old turning the Key . Knock . Knock , Knock , Knock . Who ' s there i ' th ' name of Belzebub ? Here ' s a Farmer , that hang ' d himselfe on th ' expectation of Plentie : Come in time , haue Napkins enow about you , here you ' le sweat for ' t . Knock . Knock , knock . Who ' s there in th ' other Deuils Name ? Faith here ' s an Equiuocator , that could sweare in both the Scales against eyther Scale , who committed Treason enough for Gods sake , yet could not equiuocate to Heauen : oh come in , Equiuocator . Knock . Knock , Knock , Knock . Who ' s there ? ' Faith here ' s an English Taylor come hither , for stealing out of a French Hose : Come in Taylor , here you may rost your Goose . Knock . Knock , Knock . Neuer at quiet : What are you ? but this place is too cold for Hell . Ile Deuill - Porter it no further : I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions , that goe the Primrose way to th ' euerlasting Bonfire . Knock . Anon , anon , I pray you remember the Porter . Enter Macduff , and Lenox . Macd . Was it so late , friend , ere you went to Bed , That you doe lye so late ? Port . Faith Sir , we were carowsing till the second Cock : And Drinke , Sir , is a great prouoker of three things Macd . What three things does Drinke especially prouoke ? Port . Marry , Sir , Nose - painting , Sleepe , and Vrine . Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes the desire , but it takes away the performance . Therefore much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis - heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in a sleepe , and giuing him the Lye , leaues him Macd . I beleeue , Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night Port . That it did , Sir , i ' the very Throat on me : but I requited him for his Lye , and ( I thinke ) being too strong for him , though he tooke vp my Legges sometime , yet I made a Shift to cast him . Enter Macbeth . Macd . Is thy Master stirring ? Our knocking ha ' s awak ' d him : here he comes Lenox . Good morrow , Noble Sir Macb . Good morrow both Macd . Is the King stirring , worthy Thane ? Macb . Not yet Macd . He did command me to call timely on him , I haue almost slipt the houre Macb . Ile bring you to him Macd . I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you : But yet ' tis one Macb . The labour we delight in , Physicks paine : This is the Doore Macd . Ile make so bold to call , for ' tis my limitted seruice . Exit Macduffe . Lenox . Goes the King hence to day ? Macb . He does : he did appoint so Lenox . The Night ha ' s been vnruly : Where we lay , our Chimneys were blowne downe , And ( as they say ) lamentings heard i ' th ' Ayre ; Strange Schreemes of Death , And Prophecying , with Accents terrible , Of dyre Combustion , and confus ' d Euents , New hatch ' d toth ' wofull time . The obscure Bird clamor ' d the liue - long Night . Some say , the Earth was Feuorous , And did shake Macb . ' Twas a rough Night Lenox . My young remembrance cannot paralell A fellow to it . Enter Macduff . Macd . O horror , horror , horror , Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue , nor name thee Macb . and Lenox . What ' s the matter ? Macd . Confusion now hath made his Master - peece : Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope The Lords anoynted Temple , and stole thence The Life o ' th ' Building Macb . What is ' t you say , the Life ? Lenox . Meane you his Maiestie ? Macd . Approch the Chamber , and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon . Doe not bid me speake : See , and then speake your selues : awake , awake , Exeunt . Macbeth and Lenox . Ring the Alarum Bell : Murther , and Treason , Banquo , and Donalbaine : Malcolme awake , Shake off this Downey sleepe , Deaths counterfeit , And looke on Death it selfe : vp , vp , and see The great Doomes Image : Malcolme , Banquo , As from your Graues rise vp , and walke like Sprights , To countenance this horror . Ring the Bell . Bell rings . Enter Lady . Lady . What ' s the Businesse ? That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the House ? speake , speake Macd . O gentle Lady , ' Tis not for you to heare what I can speake : The repetition in a Womans eare , Would murther as it fell . Enter Banquo . O Banquo , Banquo , Our Royall Master ' s murther ' d Lady . Woe , alas : What , in our House ? Ban . Too cruell , any where . Deare Duff , I prythee contradict thy selfe , And say , it is not so . Enter Macbeth , Lenox , and Rosse . Macb . Had I but dy ' d an houre before this chance , I had liu ' d a blessed time : for from this instant , There ' s nothing serious in Mortalitie : All is but Toyes : Renowne and Grace is dead , The Wine of Life is drawne , and the meere Lees Is left this Vault , to brag of . Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine . Donal . What is amisse ? Macb . You are , and doe not know ' t : The Spring , the Head , the Fountaine of your Blood Is stopt , the very Source of it is stopt Macd . Your Royall Father ' s murther ' d Mal . Oh , by whom ? Lenox . Those of his Chamber , as it seem ' d , had don ' t : Their Hands and Faces were all badg ' d with blood , So were their Daggers , which vnwip ' d , we found Vpon their Pillowes : they star ' d , and were distracted , No mans Life was to be trusted with them Macb . O , yet I doe repent me of my furie , That I did kill them Macd . Wherefore did you so ? Macb . Who can be wise , amaz ' d , temp ' rate , & furious , Loyall , and Neutrall , in a moment ? No man : Th ' expedition of my violent Loue Out - run the pawser , Reason . Here lay Duncan , His Siluer skinne , lac ' d with His Golden Blood , And his gash ' d Stabs , look ' d like a Breach in Nature , For Ruines wastfull entrance : there the Murtherers , Steep ' d in the Colours of their Trade ; their Daggers Vnmannerly breech ' d with gore : who could refraine , That had a heart to loue ; and in that heart , Courage , to make ' s loue knowne ? Lady . Helpe me hence , hoa Macd . Looke to the Lady Mal . Why doe we hold our tongues , That most may clayme this argument for ours ? Donal . What should be spoken here , Where our Fate hid in an augure hole , May rush , and seize vs ? Let ' s away , Our Teares are not yet brew ' d Mal . Nor our strong Sorrow Vpon the foot of Motion Banq . Looke to the Lady : And when we haue our naked Frailties hid , That suffer in exposure ; let vs meet , And question this most bloody piece of worke , To know it further . Feares and scruples shake vs : In the great Hand of God I stand , and thence , Against the vndivulg ' d pretence , I fight Of Treasonous Mallice Macd . And so doe I All . So all Macb . Let ' s briefely put on manly readinesse , And meet i ' th ' Hall together All . Well contented . Exeunt . Malc . What will you doe ? Let ' s not consort with them : To shew an vnfelt Sorrow , is an Office Which the false man do ' s easie . Ile to England Don . To Ireland , I : Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer : Where we are , there ' s Daggers in mens smiles ; The neere in blood , the neerer bloody Malc . This murtherous Shaft that ' s shot , Hath not yet lighted : and our safest way , Is to auoid the ayme . Therefore to Horse , And let vs not be daintie of leaue - taking , But shift away : there ' s warrant in that Theft , Which steales it selfe , when there ' s no mercie left . Exeunt . Scena Quarta . Enter Rosse , with an Old man . Old man . Threescore and ten I can remember well , Within the Volume of which Time , I haue seene Houres dreadfull , and things strange : but this sore Night Hath trifled former knowings Rosse . Ha , good Father , Thou seest the Heauens , as troubled with mans Act , Threatens his bloody Stage : byth ' Clock ' tis Day , And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe : Is ' t Nights predominance , or the Dayes shame , That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe , When liuing Light should kisse it ? Old man . ' Tis vnnaturall , Euen like the deed that ' s done : On Tuesday last , A Faulcon towring in her pride of place , Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at , and kill ' d Rosse . And Duncans Horses , ( A thing most strange , and certaine ) Beauteous , and swift , the Minions of their Race , Turn ' d wilde in nature , broke their stalls , flong out , Contending ' gainst Obedience , as they would Make Warre with Mankinde Old man . ' Tis said , they eate each other Rosse . They did so : To th ' amazement of mine eyes that look ' d vpon ' t . Enter Macduffe . Heere comes the good Macduffe . How goes the world Sir , now ? Macd . Why see you not ? Ross . Is ' t known who did this more then bloody deed ? Macd . Those that Macbeth hath slaine Ross . Alas the day , What good could they pretend ? Macd . They were subborned , Malcolme , and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes Are stolne away and fled , which puts vpon them Suspition of the deed Rosse . ' Gainst Nature still , Thriftlesse Ambition , that will rauen vp Thine owne liues meanes : Then ' tis most like , The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth Macd . He is already nam ' d , and gone to Scone To be inuested Rosse . Where is Duncans body ? Macd . Carried to Colmekill , The Sacred Store - house of his Predecessors , And Guardian of their Bones Rosse . Will you to Scone ? Macd . No Cosin , Ile to Fife Rosse . Well , I will thither Macd . Well may you see things wel done there : Adieu Least our old Robes sit easier then our new Rosse . Farewell , Father Old M . Gods benyson go with you , and with those That would make good of bad , and Friends of Foes . Exeunt . omnes Actus Tertius . Scena Prima . Enter Banquo . Banq . Thou hast it now , King , Cawdor , Glamis , all , As the weyard Women promis ' d , and I feare Thou playd ' st most fowly for ' t : yet it was saide It should not stand in thy Posterity , But that my selfe should be the Roote , and Father Of many Kings . If there come truth from them , As vpon thee Macbeth , their Speeches shine , Why by the verities on thee made good , May they not be my Oracles as well , And set me vp in hope . But hush , no more . Senit sounded . Enter Macbeth as King , Lady Lenox , Rosse , Lords , and Attendants . Macb . Heere ' s our chiefe Guest La . If he had beene forgotten , It had bene as a gap in our great Feast , And all - thing vnbecomming Macb . To night we hold a solemne Supper sir , And Ile request your presence Banq . Let your Highnesse Command vpon me , to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tye For euer knit Macb . Ride you this afternoone ? Ban . I , my good Lord Macb . We should haue else desir ' d your good aduice ( Which still hath been both graue , and prosperous ) In this dayes Councell : but wee ' le take to morrow . Is ' t farre you ride ? Ban . As farre , my Lord , as will fill vp the time ' Twixt this , and Supper . Goe not my Horse the better , I must become a borrower of the Night , For a darke houre , or twaine Macb . Faile not our Feast Ban . My Lord , I will not Macb . We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow ' d In England , and in Ireland , not confessing Their cruell Parricide , filling their hearers With strange inuention . But of that to morrow , When therewithall , we shall haue cause of State , Crauing vs ioyntly . Hye you to Horse : Adieu , till you returne at Night . Goes Fleance with you ? Ban . I , my good Lord : our time does call vpon ' s Macb . I wish your Horses swift , and sure of foot : And so I doe commend you to their backs . Farwell . Exit Banquo . Let euery man be master of his time , Till seuen at Night , to make societie The sweeter welcome : We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone : While then , God be with you . Exeunt . Lords . Sirrha , a word with you : Attend those men Our pleasure ? Seruant . They are , my Lord , without the Pallace Gate Macb . Bring them before vs . Exit Seruant . To be thus , is nothing , but to be safely thus Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe , And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that Which would be fear ' d . ' Tis much he dares , And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde , He hath a Wisdome , that doth guide his Valour , To act in safetie . There is none but he , Whose being I doe feare : and vnder him , My Genius is rebuk ' d , as it is said Mark Anthonies was by Caesar . He chid the Sisters , When first they put the Name of King vpon me , And bad them speake to him . Then Prophet - like , They hayl ' d him Father to a Line of Kings . Vpon my Head they plac ' d a fruitlesse Crowne , And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe , Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand , No Sonne of mine succeeding : if ' t be so , For Banquo ' s Issue haue I fil ' d my Minde , For them , the gracious Duncan haue I murther ' d , Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace Onely for them , and mine eternall Iewell Giuen to the common Enemie of Man , To make them Kings , the Seedes of Banquo Kings . Rather then so , come Fate into the Lyst , And champion me to th ' vtterance . Who ' s there ? Enter Seruant , and two Murtherers . Now goe to the Doore , and stay there till we call . Exit Seruant . Was it not yesterday we spoke together ? Murth . It was , so please your Highnesse Macb . Well then , Now haue you consider ' d of my speeches : Know , that it was he , in the times past , Which held you so vnder fortune , Which you thought had been our innocent selfe . This I made good to you , in our last conference , Past in probation with you : How you were borne in hand , how crost : The Instruments : who wrought with them : And all things else , that might To halfe a Soule , and to a Notion craz ' d , Say , Thus did Banquo 1 . Murth . You made it knowne to vs Macb . I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ? Are you so Gospell ' d , to pray for this good man , And for his Issue , whose heauie hand Hath bow ' d you to the Graue , and begger ' d Yours for euer ? 1 . Murth . We are men , my Liege Macb . I , in the Catalogue ye goe for men , As Hounds , and Greyhounds , Mungrels , Spaniels , Curres , Showghes , Water - Rugs , and Demy - Wolues are clipt All by the Name of Dogges : the valued file Distinguishes the swift , the slow , the subtle , The House - keeper , the Hunter , euery one According to the gift , which bounteous Nature Hath in him clos ' d : whereby he does receiue Particular addition , from the Bill , That writes them all alike : and so of men . Now , if you haue a station in the file , Not i ' th ' worst ranke of Manhood , say ' t , And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes , Whose execution takes your Enemie off , Grapples you to the heart ; and loue of vs , Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life , Which in his Death were perfect 2 . Murth . I am one , my Liege , Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World Hath so incens ' d , that I am recklesse what I doe , To spight the World 1 . Murth . And I another , So wearie with Disasters , tugg ' d with Fortune , That I would set my Life on any Chance , To mend it , or be rid on ' t Macb . Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie Murth . True , my Lord Macb . So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer ' st of Life : and though I could With bare - fac ' d power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking the Businesse from the common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons 2 . Murth . We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs 1 . Murth . Though our Liues - Macb . Your Spirits shine through you . Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o ' th ' time , The moment on ' t , for ' t must be done to Night , And something from the Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require a clearenesse ; and with him , To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke : Fleans , his Sonne , that keepes him companie , Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me , Then is his Fathers , must embrace the fate Of that darke houre : resolue your selues apart , Ile come to you anon Murth . We are resolu ' d , my Lord Macb . Ile call vpon you straight : abide within , It is concluded : Banquo , thy Soules flight , If it finde Heauen , must finde it out to Night . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Macbeths Lady , and a Seruant . Lady . Is Banquo gone from Court ? Seruant . I , Madame , but returnes againe to Night Lady . Say to the King , I would attend his leysure , For a few words Seruant . Madame , I will . Enter . Lady . Nought ' s had , all ' s spent . Where our desire is got without content : ' Tis safer , to be that which we destroy , Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy . Enter Macbeth . How now , my Lord , why doe you keepe alone ? Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy ' d With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what ' s done , is done Macb . We haue scorch ' d the Snake , not kill ' d it : Shee ' le close , and be her selfe , whilest our poore Mallice Remaines in danger of her former Tooth . But let the frame of things dis - ioynt , Both the Worlds suffer , Ere we will eate our Meale in feare , and sleepe In the affliction of these terrible Dreames , That shake vs Nightly : Better be with the dead , Whom we , to gayne our peace , haue sent to peace , Then on the torture of the Minde to lye In restlesse extasie . Duncane is in his Graue : After Lifes fitfull Feuer , he sleepes well , Treason ha ' s done his worst : nor Steele , nor Poyson , Mallice domestique , forraine Leuie , nothing , Can touch him further Lady . Come on : Gentle my Lord , sleeke o ' re your rugged Lookes , Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night Macb . So shall I Loue , and so I pray be you : Let your remembrance apply to Banquo , Present him Eminence , both with Eye and Tongue : Vnsafe the while , that wee must laue Our Honors in these flattering streames , And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts , Disguising what they are Lady . You must leaue this Macb . O , full of Scorpions is my Minde , deare Wife : Thou know ' st , that Banquo and his Fleans liues Lady . But in them , Natures Coppie ' s not eterne Macb . There ' s comfort yet , they are assaileable , Then be thou iocund : ere the Bat hath flowne His Cloyster ' d flight , ere to black Heccats summons The shard - borne Beetle , with his drowsie hums , Hath rung Nights yawning Peale , There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note Lady . What ' s to be done ? Macb . Be innocent of the knowledge , dearest Chuck , Till thou applaud the deed : Come , seeling Night , Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day , And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond , Which keepes me pale . Light thickens , And the Crow makes Wing toth ' Rookie Wood : Good things of Day begin to droope , and drowse , Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey ' s doe rowse . Thou maruell ' st at my words : but hold thee still , Things bad begun , make strong themselues by ill : So prythee goe with me . Exeunt . Scena Tertia . Enter three Murtherers . 1 . But who did bid thee ioyne with vs ? 3 . Macbeth 2 . He needes not our mistrust , since he deliuers Our Offices , and what we haue to doe , To the direction iust 1 . Then stand with vs : The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day . Now spurres the lated Traueller apace , To gayne the timely Inne , and neere approches The subiect of our Watch 3 . Hearke , I heare Horses Banquo within . Giue vs a Light there , hoa 2 . Then ' tis hee : The rest , that are within the note of expectation , Alreadie are i ' th ' Court 1 . His Horses goe about 3 . Almost a mile : but he does vsually , So all men doe , from hence toth ' Pallace Gate Make it their Walke . Enter Banquo and Fleans , with a Torch . 2 . A Light , a Light 3 . ' Tis hee 1 . Stand too ' t Ban . It will be Rayne to Night 1 . Let it come downe Ban . O , Trecherie ! Flye good Fleans , flye , flye , flye , Thou may ' st reuenge . O Slaue ! 3 . Who did strike out the Light ? 1 . Was ' t not the way ? 3 . There ' s but one downe : the Sonne is fled 2 . We haue lost Best halfe of our Affaire 1 . Well , let ' s away , and say how much is done . Exeunt . Scaena Quarta . Banquet prepar ' d . Enter Macbeth , Lady , Rosse , Lenox , Lords , and Attendants . Macb . You know your owne degrees , sit downe : At first and last , the hearty welcome Lords . Thankes to your Maiesty Macb . Our selfe will mingle with Society , And play the humble Host : Our Hostesse keepes her State , but in best time We will require her welcome La . Pronounce it for me Sir , to all our Friends , For my heart speakes , they are welcome . Enter first Murtherer . Macb . See they encounter thee with their harts thanks Both sides are euen : heere Ile sit i ' th ' mid ' st , Be large in mirth , anon wee ' l drinke a Measure The Table round . There ' s blood vpon thy face Mur . ' Tis Banquo ' s then Macb . ' Tis better thee without , then he within . Is he dispatch ' d ? Mur . My Lord his throat is cut , that I did for him Mac . Thou art the best o ' th ' Cut - throats , Yet hee ' s good that did the like for Fleans : If thou did ' st it , thou art the Non - pareill Mur . Most Royall Sir Fleans is scap ' d Macb . Then comes my Fit againe : I had else beene perfect ; Whole as the Marble , founded as the Rocke , As broad , and generall , as the casing Ayre : But now I am cabin ' d , crib ' d , confin ' d , bound in To sawcy doubts , and feares . But Banquo ' s safe ? Mur . I , my good Lord : safe in a ditch he bides , With twenty trenched gashes on his head ; The least a Death to Nature Macb . Thankes for that : There the growne Serpent lyes , the worme that ' s fled Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed , No teeth for th ' present . Get thee gone , to morrow Wee ' l heare our selues againe . Exit Murderer . Lady . My Royall Lord , You do not giue the Cheere , the Feast is sold That is not often vouch ' d , while ' tis a making : ' Tis giuen , with welcome : to feede were best at home : From thence , the sawce to meate is Ceremony , Meeting were bare without it . Enter the Ghost of Banquo , and sits in Macbeths place . Macb . Sweet Remembrancer : Now good digestion waite on Appetite , And health on both Lenox . May ' t please your Highnesse sit Macb . Here had we now our Countries Honor , roof ' d , Were the grac ' d person of our Banquo present : Who , may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse , Then pitty for Mischance Rosse . His absence ( Sir ) Layes blame vpon his promise . Pleas ' t your Highnesse To grace vs with your Royall Company ? Macb . The Table ' s full Lenox . Heere is a place reseru ' d Sir Macb . Where ? Lenox . Heere my good Lord . What is ' t that moues your Highnesse ? Macb . Which of you haue done this ? Lords . What , my good Lord ? Macb . Thou canst not say I did it : neuer shake Thy goary lockes at me Rosse . Gentlemen rise , his Highnesse is not well Lady . Sit worthy Friends : my Lord is often thus , And hath beene from his youth . Pray you keepe Seat , The fit is momentary , vpon a thought He will againe be well . If much you note him You shall offend him , and extend his Passion , Feed , and regard him not . Are you a man ? Macb . I , and a bold one , that dare looke on that Which might appall the Diuell La . O proper stuffe : This is the very painting of your feare : This is the Ayre - drawne - Dagger which you said Led you to Duncan . O , these flawes and starts ( Impostors to true feare ) would well become A womans story , at a Winters fire Authoriz ' d by her Grandam : shame it selfe , Why do you make such faces ? When all ' s done You looke but on a stoole Macb . Prythee see there : Behold , looke , loe , how say you : Why what care I , if thou canst nod , speake too . If Charnell houses , and our Graues must send Those that we bury , backe ; our Monuments Shall be the Mawes of Kytes La . What ? quite vnmann ' d in folly Macb . If I stand heere , I saw him La . Fie for shame Macb . Blood hath bene shed ere now , i ' th ' olden time Ere humane Statute purg ' d the gentle Weale : I , and since too , Murthers haue bene perform ' d Too terrible for the eare . The times has bene , That when the Braines were out , the man would dye , And there an end : But now they rise againe With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes , And push vs from our stooles . This is more strange Then such a murther is La . My worthy Lord Your Noble Friends do lacke you Macb . I do forget : Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends , I haue a strange infirmity , which is nothing To those that know me . Come , loue and health to all , Then Ile sit downe : Giue me some Wine , fill full : Enter Ghost . I drinke to th ' generall ioy o ' th ' whole Table , And to our deere Friend Banquo , whom we misse : Would he were heere : to all , and him we thirst , And all to all Lords . Our duties , and the pledge Mac . Auant , & quit my sight , let the earth hide thee : Thy bones are marrowlesse , thy blood is cold : Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with La . Thinke of this good Peeres But as a thing of Custome : ' Tis no other , Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time Macb . What man dare , I dare : Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare , The arm ' d Rhinoceros , or th ' Hircan Tiger , Take any shape but that , and my firme Nerues Shall neuer tremble . Or be aliue againe , And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword : If trembling I inhabit then , protest mee The Baby of a Girle . Hence horrible shadow , Vnreall mock ' ry hence . Why so , being gone I am a man againe : pray you sit still La . You haue displac ' d the mirth , Broke the good meeting , with most admir ' d disorder Macb . Can such things be , And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd , Without our speciall wonder ? You make me strange Euen to the disposition that I owe , When now I thinke you can behold such sights , And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes , When mine is blanch ' d with feare Rosse . What sights , my Lord ? La . I pray you speake not : he growes worse & worse Question enrages him : at once , goodnight . Stand not vpon the order of your going , But go at once Len . Good night , and better health Attend his Maiesty La . A kinde goodnight to all . Exit Lords . Macb . It will haue blood they say : Blood will haue Blood : Stones haue beene knowne to moue , & Trees to speake : Augures , and vnderstood Relations , haue By Maggot Pyes , & Choughes , & Rookes brought forth The secret ' st man of Blood . What is the night ? La . Almost at oddes with morning , which is which Macb . How say ' st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding La . Did you send to him Sir ? Macb . I heare it by the way : But I will send : There ' s not a one of them but in his house I keepe a Seruant Feed . I will to morrow ( And betimes I will ) to the weyard Sisters . More shall they speake : for now I am bent to know By the worst meanes , the worst , for mine owne good , All causes shall giue way . I am in blood Stept in so farre , that should I wade no more , Returning were as tedious as go ore : Strange things I haue in head , that will to hand , Which must be acted , ere they may be scand La . You lacke the season of all Natures , sleepe Macb . Come , wee ' l to sleepe : My strange & self - abuse Is the initiate feare , that wants hard vse : We are yet but yong indeed . Exeunt . Scena Quinta . Thunder . Enter the three Witches , meeting Hecat . 1 . Why how now Hecat , you looke angerly ? Hec . Haue I not reason ( Beldams ) as you are ? Sawcy , and ouer - bold , how did you dare To Trade , and Trafficke with Macbeth , In Riddles , and Affaires of death ; And I the Mistris of your Charmes , The close contriuer of all harmes , Was neuer call ' d to beare my part , Or shew the glory of our Art ? And which is worse , all you haue done Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne , Spightfull , and wrathfull , who ( as others do ) Loues for his owne ends , not for you . But make amends now : Get you gon , And at the pit of Acheron Meete me i ' th ' Morning : thither he Will come , to know his Destinie . Your Vessels , and your Spels prouide , Your Charmes , and euery thing beside ; I am for th ' Ayre : This night Ile spend Vnto a dismall , and a Fatall end . Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone . Vpon the Corner of the Moone There hangs a vap ' rous drop , profound , Ile catch it ere it come to ground ; And that distill ' d by Magicke slights , Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights , As by the strength of their illusion , Shall draw him on to his Confusion . He shall spurne Fate , scorne Death , and beare His hopes ' boue Wisedome , Grace , and Feare : And you all know , Security Is Mortals cheefest Enemie . Musicke , and a Song . Hearke , I am call ' d : my little Spirit see Sits in Foggy cloud , and stayes for me . Sing within . Come away , come away , & c . 1 Come , let ' s make hast , shee ' l soone be Backe againe . Exeunt . Scaena Sexta . Enter Lenox , and another Lord . Lenox . My former Speeches , Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther : Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne . The gracious Duncan Was pittied of Macbeth : marry he was dead : And the right valiant Banquo walk ' d too late , Whom you may say ( if ' t please you ) Fleans kill ' d , For Fleans fled : Men must not walke too late . Who cannot want the thought , how monstrous It was for Malcolme , and for Donalbane To kill their gracious Father ? Damned Fact , How it did greeue Macbeth ? Did he not straight In pious rage , the two delinquents teare , That were the Slaues of drinke , and thralles of sleepe ? Was not that Nobly done ? I , and wisely too : For ' twould haue anger ' d any heart aliue To heare the men deny ' t . So that I say , He ha ' s borne all things well , and I do thinke , That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key , ( As , and ' t please Heauen he shall not ) they should finde What ' twere to kill a Father : So should Fleans . But peace ; for from broad words , and cause he fayl ' d His presence at the Tyrants Feast , I heare Macduffe liues in disgrace . Sir , can you tell Where he bestowes himselfe ? Lord . The Sonnes of Duncane ( From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth ) Liues in the English Court , and is receyu ' d Of the most Pious Edward , with such grace , That the maleuolence of Fortune , nothing Takes from his high respect . Thither Macduffe Is gone , to pray the Holy King , vpon his ayd To wake Northumberland , and warlike Seyward , That by the helpe of these ( with him aboue ) To ratifie the Worke ) we may againe Giue to our Tables meate , sleepe to our Nights : Free from our Feasts , and Banquets bloody kniues ; Do faithfull Homage , and receiue free Honors , All which we pine for now . And this report Hath so exasperate their King , that hee Prepares for some attempt of Warre Len . Sent he to Macduffe ? Lord . He did : and with an absolute Sir , not I The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe , And hums ; as who should say , you ' l rue the time That clogges me with this Answer Lenox . And that well might Aduise him to a Caution , t ' hold what distance His wisedome can prouide . Some holy Angell Flye to the Court of England , and vnfold His Message ere he come , that a swift blessing May soone returne to this our suffering Country , Vnder a hand accurs ' d Lord . Ile send my Prayers with him . Exeunt . Actus Quartus . Scena Prima . Thunder .

Musicke and a Song . Blacke Spirits , & c . 2 By the pricking of my Thumbes , Something wicked this way comes : Open Lockes , who euer knockes . Enter Macbeth . Macb . How now you secret , black , & midnight Hags ? What is ' t you do ? All . A deed without a name Macb . I coniure you , by that which you Professe , ( How ere you come to know it ) answer me : Though you vntye the Windes , and let them fight Against the Churches : Though the yesty Waues Confound and swallow Nauigation vp : Though bladed Corne be lodg ' d , & Trees blown downe , Though Castles topple on their Warders heads : Though Pallaces , and Pyramids do slope Their heads to their Foundations : Though the treasure Of Natures Germaine , tumble altogether , Euen till destruction sicken : Answer me To what I aske you 1 Speake 2 Demand 3 Wee ' l answer 1 Say , if th ' hadst rather heare it from our mouthes , Or from our Masters Macb . Call ' em : let me see ' em 1 Powre in Sowes blood , that hath eaten Her nine Farrow : Greaze that ' s sweaten From the Murderers Gibbet , throw Into the Flame All .

Enough . He Descends . Macb . What ere thou art , for thy good caution , thanks Thou hast harp ' d my feare aright . But one word more 1 He will not be commanded : heere ' s another More potent then the first . Thunder . 2 Apparition , a Bloody Childe . 2 Appar . Macbeth , Macbeth , Macbeth Macb . Had I three eares , Il ' d heare thee Appar . Be bloody , bold , & resolute : Laugh to scorne The powre of man : For none of woman borne Shall harme Macbeth . Descends . Mac . Then liue Macduffe : what need I feare of thee ? But yet Ile make assurance : double sure , And take a Bond of Fate : thou shalt not liue , That I may tell pale - hearted Feare , it lies ; And sleepe in spight of Thunder . Thunder 3 Apparation , a Childe Crowned , with a Tree in his hand . What is this , that rises like the issue of a King , And weares vpon his Baby - brow , the round And top of Soueraignty ? All . Listen , but speake not too ' t 3 Appar . Be Lyon metled , proud , and take no care : Who chafes , who frets , or where Conspirers are : Macbeth shall neuer vanquish ' d be , vntill Great Byrnam Wood , to high Dunsmane Hill Shall come against him . Descend . Macb . That will neuer bee : Who can impresse the Forrest , bid the Tree Vnfixe his earth - bound Root ? Sweet boadments , good : Rebellious dead , rise neuer till the Wood Of Byrnan rise , and our high plac ' d Macbeth Shall liue the Lease of Nature , pay his breath To time , and mortall Custome . Yet my Hart Throbs to know one thing : Tell me , if your Art Can tell so much : Shall Banquo ' s issue euer Reigne in this Kingdome ? All . Seeke to know no more Macb . I will be satisfied . Deny me this , And an eternall Curse fall on you : Let me know . Why sinkes that Caldron ? & what noise is this ? Hoboyes 1 Shew 2 Shew 3 Shew All . Shew his Eyes , and greeue his Hart , Come like shadowes , so depart . A shew of eight Kings , and Banquo last , with a glasse in his hand . Macb . Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo : Down : Thy Crowne do ' s seare mine Eye - bals . And thy haire Thou other Gold - bound - brow , is like the first : A third , is like the former . Filthy Hagges , Why do you shew me this ? - A fourth ? Start eyes ! What will the Line stretch out to ' th ' cracke of Doome ? Another yet ? A seauenth ? Ile see no more : And yet the eighth appeares , who beares a glasse , Which shewes me many more : and some I see , That two - fold Balles , and trebble Scepters carry . Horrible sight : Now I see ' tis true , For the Blood - bolter ' d Banquo smiles vpon me , And points at them for his . What ? is this so ? 1 I Sir , all this is so . But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly ? Come Sisters , cheere we vp his sprights , And shew the best of our delights . Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound , While you performe your Antique round : That this great King may kindly say , Our duties , did his welcome pay . Musicke . The Witches Dance , and vanish . Macb . Where are they ? Gone ? Let this pernitious houre , Stand aye accursed in the Kalender . Come in , without there . Enter Lenox . Lenox . What ' s your Graces will Macb . Saw you the Weyard Sisters ? Lenox . No my Lord Macb . Came they not by you ? Lenox . No indeed my Lord Macb . Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride , And damn ' d all those that trust them . I did heare The gallopping of Horse . Who was ' t came by ? Len . ' Tis two or three my Lord , that bring you word : Macduff is fled to England Macb . Fled to England ? Len . I , my good Lord Macb . Time , thou anticipat ' st my dread exploits : The flighty purpose neuer is o ' re - tooke Vnlesse the deed go with it . From this moment , The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand . And euen now To Crown my thoughts with Acts : be it thoght & done : The Castle of Macduff , I will surprize . Seize vpon Fife ; giue to th ' edge o ' th ' Sword His Wife , his Babes , and all vnfortunate Soules That trace him in his Line . No boasting like a Foole , This deed Ile do , before this purpose coole , But no more sights . Where are these Gentlemen ? Come bring me where they are . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Macduffes Wife , her Son , and Rosse . Wife . What had he done , to make him fly the Land ? Rosse . You must haue patience Madam Wife . He had none : His flight was madnesse : when our Actions do not , Our feares do make vs Traitors Rosse . You know not Whether it was his wisedome , or his feare Wife . Wisedom ? to leaue his wife , to leaue his Babes , His Mansion , and his Titles , in a place From whence himselfe do ' s flye ? He loues vs not , He wants the naturall touch . For the poore Wren ( The most diminitiue of Birds ) will fight , Her yong ones in her Nest , against the Owle : All is the Feare , and nothing is the Loue ; As little is the Wisedome , where the flight So runnes against all reason Rosse . My deerest Cooz , I pray you schoole your selfe . But for your Husband , He is Noble , Wise , Iudicious , and best knowes The fits o ' th ' Season . I dare not speake much further , But cruell are the times , when we are Traitors And do not know our selues : when we hold Rumor From what we feare , yet know not what we feare , But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea Each way , and moue . I take my leaue of you : Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe : Things at the worst will cease , or else climbe vpward , To what they were before . My pretty Cosine , Blessing vpon you Wife . Father ' d he is , And yet hee ' s Father - lesse Rosse . I am so much a Foole , should I stay longer It would be my disgrace , and your discomfort . I take my leaue at once . Exit Rosse . Wife . Sirra , your Fathers dead , And what will you do now ? How will you liue ? Son . As Birds do Mother Wife . What with Wormes , and Flyes ? Son . With what I get I meane , and so do they Wife . Poore Bird , Thou ' dst neuer Feare the Net , nor Lime , The Pitfall , nor the Gin Son . Why should I Mother ? Poore Birds they are not set for : My Father is not dead for all your saying Wife . Yes , he is dead : How wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . Nay how will you do for a Husband ? Wife . Why I can buy me twenty at any Market Son . Then you ' l by ' em to sell againe Wife . Thou speak ' st withall thy wit , And yet I ' faith with wit enough for thee Son . Was my Father a Traitor , Mother ? Wife . I , that he was Son . What is a Traitor ? Wife . Why one that sweares , and lyes Son . And be all Traitors , that do so Wife . Euery one that do ' s so , is a Traitor , And must be hang ' d Son . And must they all be hang ' d , that swear and lye ? Wife . Euery one Son . Who must hang them ? Wife . Why , the honest men Son . Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools : for there are Lyars and Swearers enow , to beate the honest men , and hang vp them Wife . Now God helpe thee , poore Monkie : But how wilt thou do for a Father ? Son . If he were dead , youl ' d weepe for him : if you would not , it were a good signe , that I should quickely haue a new Father Wife . Poore pratler , how thou talk ' st ? Enter a Messenger . Mes . Blesse you faire Dame : I am not to you known , Though in your state of Honor I am perfect ; I doubt some danger do ' s approach you neerely . If you will take a homely mans aduice , Be not found heere : Hence with your little ones To fright you thus . Me thinkes I am too sauage : To do worse to you , were fell Cruelty , Which is too nie your person . Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer . Exit Messenger Wife . Whether should I flye ? I haue done no harme . But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ? What are these faces ? Enter Murtherers . Mur . Where is your Husband ? Wife . I hope in no place so vnsanctified , Where such as thou may ' st finde him Mur . He ' s a Traitor Son . Thou ly ' st thou shagge - ear ' d Villaine Mur . What you Egge ? Yong fry of Treachery ? Son . He ha ' s kill ' d me Mother , Run away I pray you . Exit crying Murther . Scaena Tertia . Enter Malcolme and Macduffe . Mal . Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty Macd . Let vs rather Hold fast the mortall Sword : and like good men , Bestride our downfall Birthdome : each new Morne , New Widdowes howle , new Orphans cry , new sorowes Strike heauen on the face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland , and yell ' d out Like Syllable of Dolour Mal . What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde the time to friend : I wil . What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance . This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou ' d him well , He hath not touch ' d you yet . I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp a weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease an angry God Macd . I am not treacherous Malc . But Macbeth is . A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In an Imperiall charge . But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose ; Angels are bright still , though the brightest fell . Though all things foule , would wear the brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so Macd . I haue lost my Hopes Malc . Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts . Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ? Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue - taking . I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke Macd . Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , The Title , is affear ' d . Far thee well Lord , I would not be the Villaine that thou think ' st , For the whole Space that ' s in the Tyrants Graspe , And the rich East to boot Mal . Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds . I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands . But for all this , When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede Macd . What should he be ? Mal . It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All the particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open ' d , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and the poore State Esteeme him as a Lambe , being compar ' d With my confinelesse harmes Macd . Not in the Legions Of horrid Hell , can come a Diuell more damn ' d In euils , to top Macbeth Mal . I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha ' s a name . But there ' s no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp The Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore - beare That did oppose my will . Better Macbeth , Then such an one to reigne Macd . Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is a Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne , And fall of many Kings . But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold . The time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there cannot be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde Mal . With this , there growes In my most ill - composd Affection , such A stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more - hauing , would be as a Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth Macd . This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer - seeming Lust : and it hath bin The Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne . All these are portable , With other Graces weigh ' d Mal . But I haue none . The King - becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp ' rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In the diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes . Nay , had I powre , I should Poure the sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore the vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth Macd . O Scotland , Scotland Mal . If such a one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken Mac . Fit to gouern ? No not to liue . O Natio [ n ] miserable ! With an vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ? Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do ' s blaspheme his breed ? Thy Royall Father Was a most Sainted - King : the Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy ' de euery day she liu ' d . Fare thee well , These Euils thou repeat ' st vpon thy selfe , Hath banish ' d me from Scotland . O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere Mal . Macduff , this Noble passion Childe of integrity , hath from my soule Wip ' d the blacke Scruples , reconcil ' d my thoughts To thy good Truth , and Honor . Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer - credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction . Heere abiure The taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature . I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne . At no time broke my Faith , would not betray The Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life . My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe . What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and the chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell . Why are you silent ? Macd . Such welcome , and vnwelcom things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile . Enter a Doctor . Mal . Well , more anon . Comes the King forth I pray you ? Doct . I Sir : there are a crew of wretched Soules That stay his Cure : their malady conuinces The great assay of Art . But at his touch , Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand , They presently amend . Enter . Mal . I thanke you Doctor Macd . What ' s the Disease he meanes ? Mal . Tis call ' d the Euill . A most myraculous worke in this good King , Which often since my heere remaine in England , I haue seene him do : How he solicites heauen Himselfe best knowes : but strangely visited people All swolne and Vlcerous , pittifull to the eye , The meere dispaire of Surgery , he cures , Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes , Put on with holy Prayers , and ' tis spoken To the succeeding Royalty he leaues The healing Benediction . With this strange vertue , He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie , And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne , That speake him full of Grace . Enter Rosse . Macd . See who comes heere Malc . My Countryman : but yet I know him not Macd . My euer gentle Cozen , welcome hither Malc . I know him now . Good God betimes remoue The meanes that makes vs Strangers Rosse . Sir , Amen Macd . Stands Scotland where it did ? Rosse . Alas poore Countrey , Almost affraid to know it selfe . It cannot Be call ' d our Mother , but our Graue ; where nothing But who knowes nothing , is once seene to smile : Where sighes , and groanes , and shrieks that rent the ayre Are made , not mark ' d : Where violent sorrow seemes A Moderne extasie : The Deadmans knell , Is there scarse ask ' d for who , and good mens liues Expire before the Flowers in their Caps , Dying , or ere they sicken Macd . Oh Relation ; too nice , and yet too true Malc . What ' s the newest griefe ? Rosse . That of an houres age , doth hisse the speaker , Each minute teemes a new one Macd . How do ' s my Wife ? Rosse . Why well Macd . And all my Children ? Rosse . Well too Macd . The Tyrant ha ' s not batter ' d at their peace ? Rosse . No , they were wel at peace , when I did leaue ' em Macd . Be not a niggard of your speech : How gos ' t ? Rosse . When I came hither to transport the Tydings Which I haue heauily borne , there ran a Rumour Of many worthy Fellowes , that were out , Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather , For that I saw the Tyrants Power a - foot . Now is the time of helpe : your eye in Scotland Would create Soldiours , make our women fight , To doffe their dire distresses Malc . Bee ' t their comfort We are comming thither : Gracious England hath Lent vs good Seyward , and ten thousand men , An older , and a better Souldier , none That Christendome giues out Rosse . Would I could answer This comfort with the like . But I haue words That would be howl ' d out in the desert ayre , Where hearing should not latch them Macd . What concerne they , The generall cause , or is it a Fee - griefe Due to some single brest ? Rosse . No minde that ' s honest But in it shares some woe , though the maine part Pertaines to you alone Macd . If it be mine Keepe it not from me , quickly let me haue it Rosse . Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer , Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound that euer yet they heard Macd . Humh : I guesse at it Rosse . Your Castle is surpriz ' d : your Wife , and Babes Sauagely slaughter ' d : To relate the manner Were on the Quarry of these murther ' d Deere To adde the death of you Malc . Mercifull Heauen : What man , ne ' re pull your hat vpon your browes : Giue sorrow words ; the griefe that do ' s not speake , Whispers the o ' re - fraught heart , and bids it breake Macd . My Children too ? Ro . Wife , Children , Seruants , all that could be found Macd . And I must be from thence ? My wife kil ' d too ? Rosse . I haue said Malc . Be comforted . Let ' s make vs Med ' cines of our great Reuenge , To cure this deadly greefe Macd . He ha ' s no Children . All my pretty ones ? Did you say All ? Oh Hell - Kite ! All ? What , All my pretty Chickens , and their Damme At one fell swoope ? Malc . Dispute it like a man Macd . I shall do so : But I must also feele it as a man ; I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me : Did heauen looke on , And would not take their part ? Sinfull Macduff , They were all strooke for thee : Naught that I am , Not for their owne demerits , but for mine Fell slaughter on their soules : Heauen rest them now Mal . Be this the Whetstone of your sword , let griefe Conuert to anger : blunt not the heart , enrage it Macd . O I could play the woman with mine eyes , And Braggart with my tongue . But gentle Heauens , Cut short all intermission : Front to Front , Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland , and my selfe Within my Swords length set him , if he scape Heauen forgiue him too Mal . This time goes manly : Come go we to the King , our Power is ready , Our lacke is nothing but our leaue .

A great perturbation in Nature , to receyue at once the benefit of sleep , and do the effects of watching . In this slumbry agitation , besides her walking , and other actuall performances , what ( at any time ) haue you heard her say ? Gent . That Sir , which I will not report after her Doct .

Fye , my Lord , fie , a Souldier , and affear ' d ? what need we feare ? who knowes it , when none can call our powre to accompt : yet who would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much blood in him Doct . Do you marke that ? Lad . The Thane of Fife , had a wife : where is she now ? What will these hands ne ' re be cleane ? No more o ' that my Lord , no more o ' that : you marre all with this starting Doct . Go too , go too : You haue knowne what you should not Gent . She ha ' s spoke what shee should not , I am sure of that : Heauen knowes what she ha ' s knowne La . Heere ' s the smell of the blood still : all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand . Oh , oh , oh Doct . What a sigh is there ? The hart is sorely charg ' d Gent . I would not haue such a heart in my bosome , for the dignity of the whole body Doct . Well , well , well Gent . Pray God it be sir Doct . This disease is beyond my practise : yet I haue knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep , who haue dyed holily in their beds Lad . Wash your hands , put on your Night - Gowne , looke not so pale : I tell you yet againe Banquo ' s buried ; he cannot come out on ' s graue Doct . Euen so ? Lady . To bed , to bed : there ' s knocking at the gate : Come , come , come , come , giue me your hand : What ' s done , cannot be vndone . To bed , to bed , to bed . Exit Lady . Doct . Will she go now to bed ? Gent . Directly Doct . Foule whisp ' rings are abroad : vnnaturall deeds Do breed vnnaturall troubles : infected mindes To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets : More needs she the Diuine , then the Physitian : God , God forgiue vs all . Looke after her , Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance , And still keepe eyes vpon her : So goodnight , My minde she ha ' s mated , and amaz ' d my sight .

Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother ? Len . For certaine Sir , he is not : I haue a File Of all the Gentry ; there is Seywards Sonne , And many vnruffe youths , that euen now Protest their first of Manhood Ment . What do ' s the Tyrant Cath . Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies : Some say hee ' s mad : Others , that lesser hate him , Do call it valiant Fury , but for certaine He cannot buckle his distemper ' d cause Within the belt of Rule Ang . Now do ' s he feele His secret Murthers sticking on his hands , Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith - breach : Those he commands , moue onely in command , Nothing in loue : Now do ' s he feele his Title Hang loose about him , like a Giants Robe Vpon a dwarfish Theefe Ment . Who then shall blame His pester ' d Senses to recoyle , and start , When all that is within him , do ' s condemne It selfe , for being there Cath .

Bring me no more Reports , let them flye all : Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane , I cannot taint with Feare . What ' s the Boy Malcolme ? Was he not borne of woman ? The Spirits that know All mortall Consequences , haue pronounc ' d me thus : Feare not Macbeth , no man that ' s borne of woman Shall ere haue power vpon thee . Then fly false Thanes , And mingle with the English Epicures , The minde I sway by , and the heart I beare , Shall neuer sagge with doubt , nor shake with feare . Enter Seruant .

Seyton , I am sick at hart , When I behold : Seyton , I say , this push Will cheere me euer , or dis - eate me now .

Come , put mine Armour on : giue me my Staffe : Seyton , send out : Doctor , the Thanes flye from me : Come sir , dispatch . If thou could ' st Doctor , cast The Water of my Land , finde her Disease , And purge it to a sound and pristine Health , I would applaud thee to the very Eccho , That should applaud againe . Pull ' t off I say , What Rubarb , Cyme , or what Purgatiue drugge Would scowre these English hence : hear ' st y of them ? Doct .

Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough , And bear ' t before him , thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our Hoast , and make discouery Erre in report of vs Sold . It shall be done Syw . We learne no other , but the confident Tyrant Keepes still in Dunsinane , and will indure Our setting downe befor ' t Malc .

Let our iust Censures Attend the true euent , and put we on Industrious Souldiership Sey . The time approaches , That will with due decision make vs know What we shall say we haue , and what we owe : Thoughts speculatiue , their vnsure hopes relate , But certaine issue , stroakes must arbitrate , Towards which , aduance the warre . Exeunt . marching Scena Quinta . Enter Macbeth , Seyton , & Souldiers , with Drum and Colours . Macb . Hang out our Banners on the outward walls , The Cry is still , they come : our Castles strength Will laugh a Siedge to scorne : Heere let them lye , Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp : Were they not forc ' d with those that should be ours , We might haue met them darefull , beard to beard , And beate them backward home . What is that noyse ? A Cry within of Women . Sey . It is the cry of women , my good Lord Macb . I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares : The time ha ' s beene , my sences would haue cool ' d To heare a Night - shrieke , and my Fell of haire Would at a dismall Treatise rowze , and stirre As life were in ' t . I haue supt full with horrors , Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me . Wherefore was that cry ? Sey . The Queene ( my Lord ) is dead Macb . She should haue dy ' de heereafter ; There would haue beene a time for such a word : To morrow , and to morrow , and to morrow , Creepes in this petty pace from day to day , To the last Syllable of Recorded time : And all our yesterdayes , haue lighted Fooles The way to dusty death . Out , out , breefe Candle , Life ' s but a walking Shadow , a poore Player , That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage , And then is heard no more . It is a Tale Told by an Ideot , full of sound and fury Signifying nothing . Enter a Messenger . Thou com ' st to vse thy Tongue : thy Story quickly Mes . Gracious my Lord , I should report that which I say I saw , But know not how to doo ' t Macb . Well , say sir Mes . As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill I look ' d toward Byrnane , and anon me thought The Wood began to moue Macb . Lyar , and Slaue Mes . Let me endure your wrath , if ' t be not so : Within this three Mile may you see it comming . I say , a mouing Groue Macb . If thou speak ' st false , Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue Till Famine cling thee : If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much . I pull in Resolution , and begin To doubt th ' Equiuocation of the Fiend , That lies like truth . Feare not , till Byrnane Wood Do come to Dunsinane , and now a Wood Comes toward Dunsinane . Arme , Arme , and out , If this which he auouches , do ' s appeare , There is nor flying hence , nor tarrying here . I ' ginne to be a - weary of the Sun , And wish th ' estate o ' th ' world were now vndon . Ring the Alarum Bell , blow Winde , come wracke , At least wee ' l dye with Harnesse on our backe . Exeunt . Scena Sexta . Drumme and Colours . Enter Malcolme , Seyward , Macduffe , and their Army , with Boughes . Mal .

Worthy Macduffe , and wee Shall take vpon ' s what else remaines to do , According to our order Sey . Fare you well : Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night , Let vs be beaten , if we cannot fight Macd . Make all our Trumpets speak , giue the [ m ] all breath Those clamorous Harbingers of Blood , & Death . Exeunt . Alarums continued . Scena Septima . Enter Macbeth . Macb . They haue tied me to a stake , I cannot flye , But Beare - like I must fight the course . What ' s he That was not borne of Woman ? Such a one Am I to feare , or none . Enter young Seyward . Y . Sey . What is thy name ? Macb . Thou ' lt be affraid to heare it Y . Sey . No : though thou call ' st thy selfe a hoter name Then any is in hell Macb . My name ' s Macbeth Y . Sey . The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title More hatefull to mine eare Macb . No : nor more fearefull Y . Sey . Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant , with my Sword Ile proue the lye thou speak ' st . Fight , and young Seyward slaine . Macb . Thou was ' t borne of woman ; But Swords I smile at , Weapons laugh to scorne , Brandish ' d by man that ' s of a Woman borne . Enter . Alarums . Enter Macduffe . Macd . That way the noise is : Tyrant shew thy face , If thou beest slaine , and with no stroake of mine , My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still : I cannot strike at wretched Kernes , whose armes Are hyr ' d to beare their Staues ; either thou Macbeth , Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge I sheath againe vndeeded . There thou should ' st be , By this great clatter , one of greatest note Seemes bruited . Let me finde him Fortune , And more I begge not . Exit . Alarums . Enter Malcolme and Seyward . Sey . This way my Lord , the Castles gently rendred : The Tyrants people , on both sides do fight , The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre , The day almost it selfe professes yours , And little is to do Malc . We haue met with Foes That strike beside vs Sey . Enter Sir , the Castle . Exeunt . Alarum Enter Macbeth . Macb . Why should I play the Roman Foole , and dye On mine owne sword ? whiles I see liues , the gashes Do better vpon them . Enter Macduffe . Macd . Turne Hell - hound , turne Macb . Of all men else I haue auoyded thee : But get thee backe , my soule is too much charg ' d With blood of thine already Macd . I haue no words , My voice is in my Sword , thou bloodier Villaine Then tearmes can giue thee out . Fight : Alarum Macb . Thou loosest labour As easie may ' st thou the intrenchant Ayre With thy keene Sword impresse , as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests , I beare a charmed Life , which must not yeeld To one of woman borne Macd . Dispaire thy Charme , And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru ' d Tell thee , Macduffe was from his Mothers womb Vntimely ript Macb . Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so ; For it hath Cow ' d my better part of man : And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu ' d , That palter with vs in a double sence , That keepe the word of promise to our eare , And breake it to our hope . Ile not fight with thee Macd . Then yeeld thee Coward , And liue to be the shew , and gaze o ' th ' time . Wee ' l haue thee , as our rarer Monsters are Painted vpon a pole , and vnder - writ , Heere may you see the Tyrant Macb . I will not yeeld To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet , And to be baited with the Rabbles curse . Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou oppos ' d , being of no woman borne , Yet I will try the last . Before my body , I throw my warlike Shield : Lay on Macduffe , And damn ' d be him , that first cries hold , enough . Exeunt . fighting . Alarums . Enter Fighting , and Macbeth slaine . Retreat , and Flourish . Enter with Drumme and Colours , Malcolm , Seyward , Rosse , Thanes , & Soldiers . Mal . I would the Friends we misse , were safe arriu ' d Sey . Some must go off : and yet by these I see , So great a day as this is cheapely bought Mal . Macduffe is missing , and your Noble Sonne Rosse . Your son my Lord , ha ' s paid a souldiers debt , He onely liu ' d but till he was a man , The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm ' d In the vnshrinking station where he fought , But like a man he dy ' de Sey . Then he is dead ? Rosse . I , and brought off the field : your cause of sorrow Must not be measur ' d by his worth , for then It hath no end Sey . Had he his hurts before ? Rosse . I , on the Front Sey . Why then , Gods Soldier be he : Had I as many Sonnes , as I haue haires , I would not wish them to a fairer death : And so his Knell is knoll ' d Mal . Hee ' s worth more sorrow , and that Ile spend for him Sey . He ' s worth no more , They say he parted well , and paid his score , And so God be with him . Here comes newer comfort . Enter Macduffe , with Macbeths head . Macd . Haile King , for so thou art . Behold where stands Th ' Vsurpers cursed head : the time is free : I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle , That speake my salutation in their minds : Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine . Haile King of Scotland All . Haile King of Scotland . Flourish . Mal . We shall not spend a large expence of time , Before we reckon with your seuerall loues , And make vs euen with you . My Thanes and Kinsmen Henceforth be Earles , the first that euer Scotland In such an Honor nam ' d : What ' s more to do , Which would be planted newly with the time , As calling home our exil ' d Friends abroad , That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny , Producing forth the cruell Ministers Of this dead Butcher , and his Fiend - like Queene ; Who ( as ' tis thought ) by selfe and violent hands , Tooke off her life . This , and what need full else That call ' s vpon vs , by the Grace of Grace , We will performe in measure , time , and place : So thankes to all at once , and to each one , Whom we inuite , to see vs Crown ' d at Scone .

This is Serieant , Who like good and hardie Souldier fought ' Gainst my Captiuitie : Haile braue friend ; Say to King , knowledge of Broyle , As thou didst leaue it Cap . Doubtfull it stood , As two spent Swimmers , that doe cling together , And choake their Art : mercilesse Macdonwald ( Worthie to be Rebell , for to that multiplying Villanies of Nature Doe swarme vpon him ) from Westerne Isles Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply ' d , And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling , Shew ' d like Rebells Whore : but all ' s too weake : For braue Macbeth ( well hee deserues that Name ) Disdayning Fortune , with his brandisht Steele , Which smoak ' d with bloody execution ( Like Valours Minion ) caru ' d out his passage , Till hee fac ' d Slaue : Which neu ' r shooke hands , nor bad farwell to him , Till he vnseam ' d him from Naue toth ' Chops , And fix ' d his Head vpon our Battlements King . O valiant Cousin , worthy Gentleman Cap . As whence Sunne ' gins his reflection , Shipwracking Stormes , and direfull Thunders : So from that Spring , whence comfort seem ' d to come , Discomfort swells : Marke King of Scotland , marke , No sooner Iustice had , with Valour arm ' d , Compell ' d these skipping Kernes to trust their heeles , But Norweyan Lord , surueying vantage , With furbusht Armes , and new supplyes of men , Began fresh assault King . Dismay ' d not this our Captaines , Macbeth and Banquoh ? Cap . Yes , as Sparrowes , Eagles ; Or Hare , Lyon : If I say sooth , I must report they were As Cannons ouer - charg ' d with double Cracks , So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon Foe : Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds , Or memorize another Golgotha , I cannot tell : but I am faint , My Gashes cry for helpe King . So well thy words become thee , as thy wounds , They smack of Honor both : Goe get him Surgeons . Enter Rosse and Angus . Who comes here ? Mal . worthy Thane of Rosse Lenox .

From Fiffe , great King , Where Norweyan Banners flowt Skie , And fanne our people cold . Norway himselfe , with terrible numbers , Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor , Thane of Cawdor , began dismall Conflict , Till that Bellona ' s Bridegroome , lapt in proofe , Confronted him with selfe - comparisons , Point against Point , rebellious Arme ' gainst Arme , Curbing his lauish spirit : and to conclude , Victorie fell on vs King . Great happinesse Rosse . That now Sweno , Norwayes King , Craues composition : Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men , Till he disbursed , at Saint Colmes ynch , Ten thousand Dollars , to our generall vse King .

Wee are sent , To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks , Onely to harrold thee into his sight , Not pay thee Rosse . And for earnest of greater Honor , He bad me , from him , call thee Thane of Cawdor : In which addition , haile most worthy Thane , For it is thine Banq . What , can Deuill speake true ? Macb . Thane of Cawdor liues : Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes ? Ang . Who was Thane , liues yet , But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life , Which he deserues to loose . Whether he was combin ' d with those of Norway , Or did lyne Rebell with hidden helpe , And vantage ; or that with both he labour ' d In his Countreyes wracke , I know not : But Treasons Capitall , confess ' d , and prou ' d , Haue ouerthrowne him Macb .

Cousins , word , I pray you Macb . Two Truths are told , As happy Prologues to swelling Act Of Imperiall Theame . I thanke you Gentlemen : This supernaturall solliciting Cannot be ill ; cannot be good . If ill ? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe , Commencing in Truth ? I am Thane of Cawdor . If good ? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion , Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire , And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes , Against vse of Nature ? Present Feares Are lesse then horrible Imaginings : My Thought , whose Murther yet is but fantasticall , Shakes so my single state of Man , That Function is smother ' d in surmise , And nothing is , but what is not Banq . Looke how our Partner ' s rapt Macb . If Chance will haue me King , Why Chance may Crowne me , Without my stirre Banq .

They met me in day of successe : and I haue learn ' d by perfect ' st report , they haue more in them , then mortall knowledge . When I burnt in desire to question them further , they made themselues Ayre , into which they vanish ' d . Whiles I stood rapt in wonder of it , came Missiues from King , who all - hail ' d me Thane of Cawdor , by which Title before , these weyward Sisters saluted me , and referr ' d me to comming on of time , with haile King that shalt be . This haue I thought good to deliuer thee ( my dearest Partner of Greatnesse ) that thou might ' st not loose dues of reioycing by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis ' d thee . Lay it to thy heart and farewell . Glamys thou art , and Cawdor , and shalt be What thou art promis ' d : yet doe I feare thy Nature , It is too full o ' th ' Milke of humane kindnesse , To catch neerest way . Thou would ' st be great , Art not without Ambition , but without illnesse should attend it . What thou would ' st highly , That would ' st thou holily : would ' st not play false , And yet would ' st wrongly winne . Thould ' st haue , great Glamys , that which cryes , Thus thou must doe , if thou haue it ; And that which rather thou do ' st feare to doe , Then wishest should be vndone .

Come you Spirits , That tend on mortall thoughts , vnsex me here , And fill me from Crowne to Toe , top - full Of direst Crueltie : make thick my blood , Stop vp th ' accesse , and passage to Remorse , That no compunctious visitings of Nature Shake my fell purpose , nor keepe peace betweene Th ' effect , and hit .

Heere , But heere , vpon this Banke and Schoole of time , Wee ' ld iumpe life to come . But in these Cases , We still haue iudgement heere , that we but teach Bloody Instructions , which being taught , returne To plague th ' Inuenter , this euen - handed Iustice Commends th ' Ingredience of our poyson ' d Challice To our owne lips . Hee ' s heere in double trust ; First , as I am his Kinsman , and his Subiect , Strong both against Deed : Then , as his Host , Who should against his Murtherer shut doore , Not beare knife my selfe . Besides , this Duncane Hath borne his Faculties so meeke ; hath bin So cleere in his great Office , that his Vertues Will pleade like Angels , Trumpet - tongu ' d against deepe damnation of his taking off : And Pitty , like naked New - borne - Babe , Striding blast , or Heauens Cherubin , hors ' d Vpon sightlesse Curriors of Ayre , Shall blow horrid deed in euery eye , That teares shall drowne winde . I haue no Spurre To pricke sides of my intent , but onely Vaulting Ambition , which ore - leapes it selfe , And falles on th ' other . Enter Lady . How now ? What Newes ? La . He has almost supt : why haue you left chamber ? Mac . Hath he ask ' d for me ? La . Know you not , he ha ' s ? Mac . We will proceed no further in this Businesse : He hath Honour ' d me of late , and I haue bought Golden Opinions from all sorts of people , Which would be worne now in their newest glosse , Not cast aside so soone La . Was hope drunke , Wherein you drest your selfe ? Hath it slept since ? And wakes it now to looke so greene , and pale , At what it did so freely ? From this time , Such I account thy loue . Art thou affear ' d To be same in thine owne Act , and Valour , As thou art in desire ? Would ' st thou haue that Which thou esteem ' st Ornament of Life , And liue Coward in thine owne Esteeme ?

What Beast was ' t then That made you breake this enterprize to me ? When you durst do it , then you were man : And to be more then what you were , you would Be so much more man . Nor time , nor place Did then adhere , and yet you would make both : They haue made themselues , and that their fitnesse now Do ' s vnmake you . I haue giuen Sucke , and know How tender ' tis to loue Babe that milkes me , I would , while it was smyling in my Face , Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes , And dasht Braines out , had I so sworne As you haue done to this Macb . If we should faile ? Lady . We faile ? But screw your courage to sticking place , And wee ' le not fayle : when Duncan is asleepe , ( Whereto rather shall his dayes hard Iourney Soundly inuite him ) his two Chamberlaines Will I with Wine , and Wassell , so conuince , That Memorie , Warder of Braine , Shall be Fume , and Receit of Reason Lymbeck onely : when in Swinish sleepe , Their drenched Natures lyes as in Death , What cannot you and I performe vpon Th ' vnguarded Duncan ? What not put vpon His spungie Officers ? who shall beare guilt Of our great quell Macb . Bring forth Men - Children onely : For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose Nothing but Males . Will it not be receiu ' d , When we haue mark ' d with blood those sleepie two Of his owne Chamber , and vs ' d their very Daggers , That they haue don ' t ? Lady . Who dares receiue it other , As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore , Vpon his Death ? Macb . I am settled , and bend vp Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat .

Hold , take my Sword : There ' s Husbandry in Heauen , Their Candles are all out : take thee that too . heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me , And yet I would not sleepe : Mercifull Powers , restraine in me cursed thoughts That Nature giues way to in repose . Enter Macbeth , and Seruant with Torch . Giue me my Sword : who ' s there ? Macb . Friend Banq . What Sir , not yet at rest ? King ' s bed .

Being vnprepar ' d , Our will became seruant to defect , Which else should free haue wrought Banq . All ' s well . I dreamt last Night of three weyward Sisters : To you they haue shew ' d some truth Macb . I thinke not of them : Yet when we can entreat houre to serue , We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse , If you would graunt time Banq . At your kind ' st leysure Macb . If you shall cleaue to my consent , When ' tis , it shall make Honor for you Banq . So I lose none , In seeking to augment it , but still keepe My Bosome franchis ' d , and Allegeance cleare , I shall be counsail ' d Macb . Good repose while Banq . Thankes Sir : like to you . Exit Banquo . Macb . Goe bid thy Mistresse , when my drinke is ready , She strike vpon Bell . Get thee to bed . Enter . Is this Dagger , which I see before me , Handle toward my Hand ? Come , let me clutch thee : I haue thee not , and yet I see thee still . Art thou not fatall Vision , sensible To feeling , as to sight ? or art thou but Dagger of Minde , false Creation , Proceeding from heat - oppressed Braine ? I see thee yet , in forme as palpable , As this which now I draw . Thou marshall ' st me way that I was going , And such Instrument I was to vse . Mine Eyes are made fooles o ' th ' other Sences , Or else worth all rest : I see thee still ; And on thy Blade , and Dudgeon , Gouts of Blood , Which was not so before . There ' s no such thing : It is bloody Businesse , which informes Thus to mine Eyes . Now o ' re one halfe World Nature seemes dead , and wicked Dreames abuse Curtain ' d sleepe : Witchcraft celebrates Pale Heccats Offrings : and wither ' d Murther , Alarum ' d by his Centinell , Wolfe , Whose howle ' s his Watch , thus with his stealthy pace , With Tarquins rauishing sides , towards his designe Moues like Ghost . Thou sowre and firme - set Earth Heare not my steps , which they may walke , for feare Thy very stones prate of my where - about , And take present horror from time , Which now sutes with it . Whiles I threat , he liues : Words to heat of deedes too cold breath giues . Bell rings . I goe , and it is done : Bell inuites me .

This is sorry sight Lady . foolish thought , to say sorry sight Macb . There ' s one did laugh in ' s sleepe , And one cry ' d Murther , that they did wake each other : I stood , and heard them : But they did say their Prayers , And addrest them againe to sleepe Lady . There are two lodg ' d together Macb . One cry ' d God blesse vs , and Amen other , As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands : Listning their feare , I could not say Amen , When they did say God blesse vs Lady . Consider it not so deepely Mac . But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen ? I had most need of Blessing , and Amen stuck in my throat Lady . These deeds must not be thought After these wayes : so , it will make vs mad Macb . Me thought I heard voyce cry , Sleep no more : Macbeth does murther Sleepe , innocent Sleepe , Sleepe that knits vp rauel ' d Sleeue of Care , death of each dayes Life , sore Labors Bath , Balme of hurt Mindes , great Natures second Course , Chiefe nourisher in Life ' s Feast Lady . What doe you meane ? Macb . Still it cry ' d , Sleepe no more to all House : Glamis hath murther ' d Sleepe , and therefore Cawdor Shall sleepe no more : Macbeth shall sleepe no more Lady . Who was it , that thus cry ' d ? why worthy Thane , You doe vnbend your Noble strength , to thinke So braine - sickly of things : Goe get some Water , And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand . Why did you bring these Daggers from place ? They must lye there : goe carry them , and smeare sleepie Groomes with blood Macb . Ile goe no more : I am afraid , to thinke what I haue done : Looke on ' t againe , I dare not Lady . Infirme of purpose : Giue me Daggers : sleeping , and dead , Are but as Pictures : ' tis Eye of Childhood , That feares painted Deuill . If he doe bleed , Ile guild Faces of Groomes withall , For it must seeme their Guilt . Enter . Knocke within . Macb . Whence is that knocking ? How is ' t with me , when euery noyse appalls me ?

Marry , Sir , Nose - painting , Sleepe , and Vrine . Lecherie , Sir , it prouokes , and vnprouokes : it prouokes desire , but it takes away performance . Therefore much Drinke may be said to be Equiuocator with Lecherie : it makes him , and it marres him ; it sets him on , and it takes him off ; it perswades him , and dis - heartens him ; makes him stand too , and not stand too : in conclusion , equiuocates him in sleepe , and giuing him Lye , leaues him Macd . I beleeue , Drinke gaue thee Lye last Night Port .

Murth . You made it knowne to vs Macb . I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting . Doe you finde your patience so predominant , In your nature , that you can let this goe ? Are you so Gospell ' d , to pray for this good man , And for his Issue , whose heauie hand Hath bow ' d you to Graue , and begger ' d Yours for euer ? 1 . Murth . We are men , my Liege Macb .

True , my Lord Macb . So is he mine : and in such bloody distance , That euery minute of his being , thrusts Against my neer ' st of Life : and though I could With bare - fac ' d power sweepe him from my sight , And bid my will auouch it ; yet I must not , For certaine friends that are both his , and mine , Whose loues I may not drop , but wayle his fall , Who I my selfe struck downe : and thence it is , That I to your assistance doe make loue , Masking Businesse from common Eye , For sundry weightie Reasons 2 . Murth . We shall , my Lord , Performe what you command vs 1 . Murth . Though our Liues - Macb . Your Spirits shine through you . Within this houre , at most , I will aduise you where to plant your selues , Acquaint you with perfect Spy o ' th ' time , moment on ' t , for ' t must be done to Night , And something from Pallace : alwayes thought , That I require clearenesse ; and with him , To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in Worke : Fleans , his Sonne , that keepes him companie , Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me , Then is his Fathers , must embrace fate Of that darke houre : resolue your selues apart , Ile come to you anon Murth .

Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making , Vsing those Thoughts , which should indeed haue dy ' d With them they thinke on : things without all remedie Should be without regard : what ' s done , is done Macb . We haue scorch ' d Snake , not kill ' d it : Shee ' le close , and be her selfe , whilest our poore Mallice Remaines in danger of her former Tooth . But let frame of things dis - ioynt , Both Worlds suffer , Ere we will eate our Meale in feare , and sleepe In affliction of these terrible Dreames , That shake vs Nightly : Better be with dead , Whom we , to gayne our peace , haue sent to peace , Then on torture of Minde to lye In restlesse extasie . Duncane is in his Graue : After Lifes fitfull Feuer , he sleepes well , Treason ha ' s done his worst : nor Steele , nor Poyson , Mallice domestique , forraine Leuie , nothing , Can touch him further Lady . Come on : Gentle my Lord , sleeke o ' re your rugged Lookes , Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night Macb . So shall I Loue , and so I pray be you : Let your remembrance apply to Banquo , Present him Eminence , both with Eye and Tongue : Vnsafe while , that wee must laue Our Honors in these flattering streames , And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts , Disguising what they are Lady . You must leaue this Macb . O , full of Scorpions is my Minde , deare Wife : Thou know ' st , that Banquo and his Fleans liues Lady . But in them , Natures Coppie ' s not eterne Macb . There ' s comfort yet , they are assaileable , Then be thou iocund : ere Bat hath flowne His Cloyster ' d flight , ere to black Heccats summons shard - borne Beetle , with his drowsie hums , Hath rung Nights yawning Peale , There shall be done deed of dreadfull note Lady . What ' s to be done ? Macb . Be innocent of knowledge , dearest Chuck , Till thou applaud deed : Come , seeling Night , Skarfe vp tender Eye of pittifull Day , And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond , Which keepes me pale . Light thickens , And Crow makes Wing toth ' Rookie Wood : Good things of Day begin to droope , and drowse , Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey ' s doe rowse .

My former Speeches , Haue but hit your Thoughts Which can interpret farther : Onely I say Things haue bin strangely borne . gracious Duncan Was pittied of Macbeth : marry he was dead : And right valiant Banquo walk ' d too late , Whom you may say ( if ' t please you ) Fleans kill ' d , For Fleans fled : Men must not walke too late . Who cannot want thought , how monstrous It was for Malcolme , and for Donalbane To kill their gracious Father ? Damned Fact , How it did greeue Macbeth ? Did he not straight In pious rage , two delinquents teare , That were Slaues of drinke , and thralles of sleepe ? Was not that Nobly done ? I , and wisely too : For ' twould haue anger ' d any heart aliue To heare men deny ' t . So that I say , He ha ' s borne all things well , and I do thinke , That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key , ( As , and ' t please Heauen he shall not ) they should finde What ' twere to kill Father : So should Fleans . But peace ; for from broad words , and cause he fayl ' d His presence at Tyrants Feast , I heare Macduffe liues in disgrace . Sir , can you tell Where he bestowes himselfe ? Lord . Sonnes of Duncane ( From whom this Tyrant holds due of Birth ) Liues in English Court , and is receyu ' d Of most Pious Edward , with such grace , That maleuolence of Fortune , nothing Takes from his high respect . Thither Macduffe Is gone , to pray Holy King , vpon his ayd To wake Northumberland , and warlike Seyward , That by helpe of these ( with him aboue ) To ratifie Worke ) we may againe Giue to our Tables meate , sleepe to our Nights : Free from our Feasts , and Banquets bloody kniues ; Do faithfull Homage , and receiue free Honors , All which we pine for now . And this report Hath so exasperate their King , that hee Prepares for some attempt of Warre Len . Sent he to Macduffe ? Lord . He did : and with absolute Sir , not I clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe , And hums ; as who should say , you ' l rue time That clogges me with this Answer Lenox . And that well might Aduise him to Caution , t ' hold what distance His wisedome can prouide .

Horrible sight : Now I see ' tis true , For Blood - bolter ' d Banquo smiles vpon me , And points at them for his . What ? is this so ? 1 I Sir , all this is so . But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly ? Come Sisters , cheere we vp his sprights , And shew best of our delights . Ile Charme Ayre to giue sound , While you performe your Antique round : That this great King may kindly say , Our duties , did his welcome pay . Musicke . Witches Dance , and vanish . Macb .

Seize vpon Fife ; giue to th ' edge o ' th ' Sword His Wife , his Babes , and all vnfortunate Soules That trace him in his Line . No boasting like Foole , This deed Ile do , before this purpose coole , But no more sights . Where are these Gentlemen ? Come bring me where they are . Exeunt . Scena Secunda . Enter Macduffes Wife , her Son , and Rosse . Wife . What had he done , to make him fly Land ? Rosse . You must haue patience Madam Wife . He had none : His flight was madnesse : when our Actions do not , Our feares do make vs Traitors Rosse . You know not Whether it was his wisedome , or his feare Wife . Wisedom ? to leaue his wife , to leaue his Babes , His Mansion , and his Titles , in place From whence himselfe do ' s flye ? He loues vs not , He wants naturall touch . For poore Wren ( most diminitiue of Birds ) will fight , Her yong ones in her Nest , against Owle : All is Feare , and nothing is Loue ; As little is Wisedome , where flight So runnes against all reason Rosse . My deerest Cooz , I pray you schoole your selfe . But for your Husband , He is Noble , Wise , Iudicious , and best knowes fits o ' th ' Season . I dare not speake much further , But cruell are times , when we are Traitors And do not know our selues : when we hold Rumor From what we feare , yet know not what we feare , But floate vpon wilde and violent Sea Each way , and moue .

Yes , he is dead : How wilt thou do for Father ? Son . Nay how will you do for Husband ? Wife . Why I can buy me twenty at any Market Son . Then you ' l by ' em to sell againe Wife . Thou speak ' st withall thy wit , And yet I ' faith with wit enough for thee Son . Was my Father Traitor , Mother ? Wife . I , that he was Son . What is Traitor ? Wife . Why one that sweares , and lyes Son . And be all Traitors , that do so Wife . Euery one that do ' s so , is Traitor , And must be hang ' d Son . And must they all be hang ' d , that swear and lye ? Wife . Euery one Son . Who must hang them ? Wife . Why , honest men Son . Then Liars and Swearers are Fools : for there are Lyars and Swearers enow , to beate honest men , and hang vp them Wife . Now God helpe thee , poore Monkie : But how wilt thou do for Father ? Son .

Me thinkes I am too sauage : To do worse to you , were fell Cruelty , Which is too nie your person . Heauen preserue you , I dare abide no longer . Exit Messenger Wife . Whether should I flye ? I haue done no harme . But I remember now I am in this earthly world : where to do harme Is often laudable , to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly . Why then ( alas ) Do I put vp that womanly defence , To say I haue done no harme ? What are these faces ? Enter Murtherers . Mur . Where is your Husband ? Wife . I hope in no place so vnsanctified , Where such as thou may ' st finde him Mur . He ' s Traitor Son . Thou ly ' st thou shagge - ear ' d Villaine Mur . What you Egge ? Yong fry of Treachery ? Son . He ha ' s kill ' d me Mother , Run away I pray you . Exit crying Murther . Scaena Tertia . Enter Malcolme and Macduffe . Mal . Let vs seeke out some desolate shade , & there Weepe our sad bosomes empty Macd . Let vs rather Hold fast mortall Sword : and like good men , Bestride our downfall Birthdome : each new Morne , New Widdowes howle , new Orphans cry , new sorowes Strike heauen on face , that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland , and yell ' d out Like Syllable of Dolour Mal . What I beleeue , Ile waile ; What know , beleeue ; and what I can redresse , As I shall finde time to friend : I wil . What you haue spoke , it may be so perchance . This Tyrant , whose sole name blisters our tongues , Was once thought honest : you haue lou ' d him well , He hath not touch ' d you yet . I am yong , but something You may discerne of him through me , and wisedome To offer vp weake , poore innocent Lambe T ' appease angry God Macd . I am not treacherous Malc . But Macbeth is . good and vertuous Nature may recoyle In Imperiall charge . But I shall craue your pardon : That which you are , my thoughts cannot transpose ; Angels are bright still , though brightest fell . Though all things foule , would wear brows of grace Yet Grace must still looke so Macd . I haue lost my Hopes Malc . Perchance euen there Where I did finde my doubts . Why in that rawnesse left you Wife , and Childe ? Those precious Motiues , those strong knots of Loue , Without leaue - taking . I pray you , Let not my Iealousies , be your Dishonors , But mine owne Safeties : you may be rightly iust , What euer I shall thinke Macd . Bleed , bleed poore Country , Great Tyrrany , lay thou thy basis sure , For goodnesse dare not check thee : wear y thy wrongs , Title , is affear ' d . Far thee well Lord , I would not be Villaine that thou think ' st , For whole Space that ' s in Tyrants Graspe , And rich East to boot Mal . Be not offended : I speake not as in absolute feare of you : I thinke our Country sinkes beneath yoake , It weepes , it bleeds , and each new day gash Is added to her wounds . I thinke withall , There would be hands vplifted in my right : And heere from gracious England haue I offer Of goodly thousands . But for all this , When I shall treade vpon Tyrants head , Or weare it on my Sword ; yet my poore Country Shall haue more vices then it had before , More suffer , and more sundry wayes then euer , By him that shall succeede Macd . What should he be ? Mal . It is my selfe I meane : in whom I know All particulars of Vice so grafted , That when they shall be open ' d , blacke Macbeth Will seeme as pure as Snow , and poore State Esteeme him as Lambe , being compar ' d With my confinelesse harmes Macd . Not in Legions Of horrid Hell , can come Diuell more damn ' d In euils , to top Macbeth Mal . I grant him Bloody , Luxurious , Auaricious , False , Deceitfull , Sodaine , Malicious , smacking of euery sinne That ha ' s name . But there ' s no bottome , none In my Voluptuousnesse : Your Wiues , your Daughters , Your Matrons , and your Maides , could not fill vp Cesterne of my Lust , and my Desire All continent Impediments would ore - beare That did oppose my will . Better Macbeth , Then such one to reigne Macd . Boundlesse intemperance In Nature is Tyranny : It hath beene Th ' vntimely emptying of happy Throne , And fall of many Kings . But feare not yet To take vpon you what is yours : you may Conuey your pleasures in spacious plenty , And yet seeme cold . time you may so hoodwinke : We haue willing Dames enough : there cannot be That Vulture in you , to deuoure so many As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues , Finding it so inclinde Mal . With this , there growes In my most ill - composd Affection , such stanchlesse Auarice , that were I King , I should cut off Nobles for their Lands , Desire his Iewels , and this others House , And my more - hauing , would be as Sawce To make me hunger more , that I should forge Quarrels vniust against Good and Loyall , Destroying them for wealth Macd . This Auarice stickes deeper : growes with more pernicious roote Then Summer - seeming Lust : and it hath bin Sword of our slaine Kings : yet do not feare , Scotland hath Foysons , to fill vp your will Of your meere Owne . All these are portable , With other Graces weigh ' d Mal . But I haue none . King - becoming Graces , As Iustice , Verity , Temp ' rance , Stablenesse , Bounty , Perseuerance , Mercy , Lowlinesse , Deuotion , Patience , Courage , Fortitude , I haue no rellish of them , but abound In diuision of each seuerall Crime , Acting it many wayes . Nay , had I powre , I should Poure sweet Milke of Concord , into Hell , Vprore vniuersall peace , confound All vnity on earth Macd . O Scotland , Scotland Mal . If such one be fit to gouerne , speake : I am as I haue spoken Mac . Fit to gouern ? No not to liue . O Natio [ n ] miserable ! With vntitled Tyrant , bloody Sceptred , When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe ? Since that truest Issue of thy Throne By his owne Interdiction stands accust , And do ' s blaspheme his breed ? Thy Royall Father Was most Sainted - King : Queene that bore thee , Oftner vpon her knees , then on her feet , Dy ' de euery day she liu ' d . Fare thee well , These Euils thou repeat ' st vpon thy selfe , Hath banish ' d me from Scotland . O my Brest , Thy hope ends heere Mal . Macduff , this Noble passion Childe of integrity , hath from my soule Wip ' d blacke Scruples , reconcil ' d my thoughts To thy good Truth , and Honor . Diuellish Macbeth , By many of these traines , hath sought to win me Into his power : and modest Wisedome pluckes me From ouer - credulous hast : but God aboue Deale betweene thee and me ; For euen now I put my selfe to thy Direction , and Vnspeake mine owne detraction . Heere abiure taints , and blames I laide vpon my selfe , For strangers to my Nature . I am yet Vnknowne to Woman , neuer was forsworne , Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne . At no time broke my Faith , would not betray Deuill to his Fellow , and delight No lesse in truth then life . My first false speaking Was this vpon my selfe . What I am truly Is thine , and my poore Countries to command : Whither indeed , before they heere approach Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men Already at point , was setting foorth : Now wee ' l together , and chance of goodnesse Be like our warranted Quarrell . Why are you silent ? Macd . Such welcome , and vnwelcom things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile . Enter Doctor . Mal . Well , more anon . Comes King forth I pray you ? Doct .

Mal . I thanke you Doctor Macd . What ' s Disease he meanes ? Mal . Tis call ' d Euill . most myraculous worke in this good King , Which often since my heere remaine in England , I haue seene him do : How he solicites heauen Himselfe best knowes : but strangely visited people All swolne and Vlcerous , pittifull to eye , meere dispaire of Surgery , he cures , Hanging golden stampe about their neckes , Put on with holy Prayers , and ' tis spoken To succeeding Royalty he leaues healing Benediction . With this strange vertue , He hath heauenly guift of Prophesie , And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne , That speake him full of Grace . Enter Rosse . Macd . See who comes heere Malc .

Stands Scotland where it did ? Rosse . Alas poore Countrey , Almost affraid to know it selfe . It cannot Be call ' d our Mother , but our Graue ; where nothing But who knowes nothing , is once seene to smile : Where sighes , and groanes , and shrieks that rent ayre Are made , not mark ' d : Where violent sorrow seemes Moderne extasie : Deadmans knell , Is there scarse ask ' d for who , and good mens liues Expire before Flowers in their Caps , Dying , or ere they sicken Macd . Oh Relation ; too nice , and yet too true Malc . What ' s newest griefe ? Rosse . That of houres age , doth hisse speaker , Each minute teemes new one Macd . How do ' s my Wife ? Rosse . Why well Macd . And all my Children ? Rosse . Well too Macd . Tyrant ha ' s not batter ' d at their peace ? Rosse . No , they were wel at peace , when I did leaue ' em Macd . Be not niggard of your speech : How gos ' t ? Rosse . When I came hither to transport Tydings Which I haue heauily borne , there ran Rumour Of many worthy Fellowes , that were out , Which was to my beleefe witnest rather , For that I saw Tyrants Power - foot . Now is time of helpe : your eye in Scotland Would create Soldiours , make our women fight , To doffe their dire distresses Malc . Bee ' t their comfort We are comming thither : Gracious England hath Lent vs good Seyward , and ten thousand men , older , and better Souldier , none That Christendome giues out Rosse . Would I could answer This comfort with like . But I haue words That would be howl ' d out in desert ayre , Where hearing should not latch them Macd . What concerne they , generall cause , or is it Fee - griefe Due to some single brest ? Rosse . No minde that ' s honest But in it shares some woe , though maine part Pertaines to you alone Macd . If it be mine Keepe it not from me , quickly let me haue it Rosse . Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer , Which shall possesse them with heauiest sound that euer yet they heard Macd . Humh : I guesse at it Rosse . Your Castle is surpriz ' d : your Wife , and Babes Sauagely slaughter ' d : To relate manner Were on Quarry of these murther ' d Deere To adde death of you Malc . Mercifull Heauen : What man , ne ' re pull your hat vpon your browes : Giue sorrow words ; griefe that do ' s not speake , Whispers o ' re - fraught heart , and bids it breake Macd . My Children too ? Ro . Wife , Children , Seruants , all that could be found Macd . And I must be from thence ? My wife kil ' d too ? Rosse . I haue said Malc . Be comforted . Let ' s make vs Med ' cines of our great Reuenge , To cure this deadly greefe Macd . He ha ' s no Children . All my pretty ones ? Did you say All ? Oh Hell - Kite ! All ? What , All my pretty Chickens , and their Damme At one fell swoope ? Malc . Dispute it like man Macd . I shall do so : But I must also feele it as man ; I cannot but remember such things were That were most precious to me : Did heauen looke on , And would not take their part ? Sinfull Macduff , They were all strooke for thee : Naught that I am , Not for their owne demerits , but for mine Fell slaughter on their soules : Heauen rest them now Mal . Be this Whetstone of your sword , let griefe Conuert to anger : blunt not heart , enrage it Macd . O I could play woman with mine eyes , And Braggart with my tongue . But gentle Heauens , Cut short all intermission : Front to Front , Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland , and my selfe Within my Swords length set him , if he scape Heauen forgiue him too Mal . This time goes manly : Come go we to King , our Power is ready , Our lacke is nothing but our leaue .

What is that noyse ? Cry within of Women . Sey . It is cry of women , my good Lord Macb . I haue almost forgot taste of Feares : time ha ' s beene , my sences would haue cool ' d To heare Night - shrieke , and my Fell of haire Would at dismall Treatise rowze , and stirre As life were in ' t . I haue supt full with horrors , Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Cannot once start me . Wherefore was that cry ? Sey . Queene ( my Lord ) is dead Macb . She should haue dy ' de heereafter ; There would haue beene time for such word : To morrow , and to morrow , and to morrow , Creepes in this petty pace from day to day , To last Syllable of Recorded time : And all our yesterdayes , haue lighted Fooles way to dusty death . Out , out , breefe Candle , Life ' s but walking Shadow , poore Player , That struts and frets his houre vpon Stage , And then is heard no more . It is Tale Told by Ideot , full of sound and fury Signifying nothing . Enter Messenger . Thou com ' st to vse thy Tongue : thy Story quickly Mes .

Let me endure your wrath , if ' t be not so : Within this three Mile may you see it comming . I say , mouing Groue Macb . If thou speak ' st false , Vpon next Tree shall thou hang aliue Till Famine cling thee : If thy speech be sooth , I care not if thou dost for me as much . I pull in Resolution , and begin To doubt th ' Equiuocation of Fiend , That lies like truth . Feare not , till Byrnane Wood Do come to Dunsinane , and now Wood Comes toward Dunsinane . Arme , Arme , and out , If this which he auouches , do ' s appeare , There is nor flying hence , nor tarrying here . I ' ginne to be - weary of Sun , And wish th ' estate o ' th ' world were now vndon . Ring Alarum Bell , blow Winde , come wracke , At least wee ' l dye with Harnesse on our backe . Exeunt .

Worthy Macduffe , and wee Shall take vpon ' s what else remaines to do , According to our order Sey . Fare you well : Do we but finde Tyrants power to night , Let vs be beaten , if we cannot fight Macd .

Sey . diuell himselfe could not pronounce Title More hatefull to mine eare Macb . No : nor more fearefull Y . Sey . Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant , with my Sword Ile proue lye thou speak ' st . Fight , and young Seyward slaine . Macb . Thou was ' t borne of woman ; But Swords I smile at , Weapons laugh to scorne , Brandish ' d by man that ' s of Woman borne . Enter . Alarums . Enter Macduffe . Macd . That way noise is : Tyrant shew thy face , If thou beest slaine , and with no stroake of mine , My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still : I cannot strike at wretched Kernes , whose armes Are hyr ' d to beare their Staues ; either thou Macbeth , Or else my Sword with vnbattered edge I sheath againe vndeeded . There thou should ' st be , By this great clatter , one of greatest note Seemes bruited . Let me finde him Fortune , And more I begge not . Exit . Alarums . Enter Malcolme and Seyward . Sey . This way my Lord , Castles gently rendred : Tyrants people , on both sides do fight , Noble Thanes do brauely in Warre , day almost it selfe professes yours , And little is to do Malc . We haue met with Foes That strike beside vs Sey . Enter Sir , Castle . Exeunt . Alarum Enter Macbeth . Macb . Why should I play Roman Foole , and dye On mine owne sword ? whiles I see liues , gashes Do better vpon them . Enter Macduffe . Macd . Turne Hell - hound , turne Macb . Of all men else I haue auoyded thee : But get thee backe , my soule is too much charg ' d With blood of thine already Macd . I haue no words , My voice is in my Sword , thou bloodier Villaine Then tearmes can giue thee out . Fight : Alarum Macb . Thou loosest labour As easie may ' st thou intrenchant Ayre With thy keene Sword impresse , as make me bleed : Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests , I beare charmed Life , which must not yeeld To one of woman borne Macd . Dispaire thy Charme , And let Angell whom thou still hast seru ' d Tell thee , Macduffe was from his Mothers womb Vntimely ript Macb . Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so ; For it hath Cow ' d my better part of man : And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu ' d , That palter with vs in double sence , That keepe word of promise to our eare , And breake it to our hope . Ile not fight with thee Macd . Then yeeld thee Coward , And liue to be shew , and gaze o ' th ' time . Wee ' l haue thee , as our rarer Monsters are Painted vpon pole , and vnder - writ , Heere may you see Tyrant Macb . I will not yeeld To kisse ground before young Malcolmes feet , And to be baited with Rabbles curse . Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane , And thou oppos ' d , being of no woman borne , Yet I will try last . Before my body , I throw my warlike Shield : Lay on Macduffe , And damn ' d be him , that first cries hold , enough . Exeunt . fighting . Alarums . Enter Fighting , and Macbeth slaine .

Your son my Lord , ha ' s paid souldiers debt , He onely liu ' d but till he was man , which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm ' d In vnshrinking station where he fought , But like man he dy ' de Sey . Then he is dead ? Rosse . I , and brought off field : your cause of sorrow Must not be measur ' d by his worth , for then It hath no end Sey . Had he his hurts before ? Rosse . I , on Front Sey . Why then , Gods Soldier be he : Had I as many Sonnes , as I haue haires , I would not wish them to fairer death : And so his Knell is knoll ' d Mal . Hee ' s worth more sorrow , and that Ile spend for him Sey . He ' s worth no more , They say he parted well , and paid his score , And so God be with him . Here comes newer comfort . Enter Macduffe , with Macbeths head . Macd . Haile King , for so thou art . Behold where stands Th ' Vsurpers cursed head : time is free : I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle , That speake my salutation in their minds : Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine .

My Thanes and Kinsmen Henceforth be Earles , first that euer Scotland In such Honor nam ' d : What ' s more to do , Which would be planted newly with time , As calling home our exil ' d Friends abroad , That fled Snares of watchfull Tyranny , Producing forth cruell Ministers Of this dead Butcher , and his Fiend - like Queene ; Who ( as ' tis thought ) by selfe and violent hands , Tooke off her life . This , and what need full else That call ' s vpon vs , by Grace of Grace , We will performe in measure , time , and place : So thankes to all at once , and to each one , Whom we inuite , to see vs Crown ' d at Scone .
